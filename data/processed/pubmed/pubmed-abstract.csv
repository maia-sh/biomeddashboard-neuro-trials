31911635,1,"ATP signaling and surface P2X4 receptors are upregulated selectively in neurons and/or glia in various CNS disorders including anxiety, chronic pain, epilepsy, ischemia, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the cell-specific functions of P2X4 in pathological contexts remain elusive. To elucidate P2X4 functions, we created a conditional transgenic knock-in P2X4 mouse line (Floxed P2X4mCherryIN) allowing the Cre activity-dependent genetic swapping of the internalization motif of P2X4 by the fluorescent mCherry protein to prevent constitutive endocytosis of P2X4. By combining molecular, cellular, electrophysiological, and behavioral approaches, we characterized two distinct knock-in mouse lines expressing noninternalized P2X4mCherryIN either exclusively in excitatory forebrain neurons or in all cells natively expressing P2X4. The genetic substitution of wild-type P2X4 by noninternalized P2X4mCherryIN in both knock-in mouse models did not alter the sparse distribution and subcellular localization of P2X4 but increased the number of P2X4 receptors at the surface of the targeted cells mimicking the pathological increased surface P2X4 state. Increased surface P2X4 density in the hippocampus of knock-in mice altered LTP and LTD plasticity phenomena at CA1 synapses without affecting basal excitatory transmission. Moreover, these cellular events translated into anxiolytic effects and deficits in spatial memory. Our results show that increased surface density of neuronal P2X4 contributes to synaptic deficits and alterations in anxiety and memory functions consistent with the implication of P2X4 in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, these conditional P2X4mCherryIN knock-in mice will allow exploring the cell-specific roles of P2X4 in various physiological and pathological contexts.",NA,NA,NA
32017127,1,"Adult neural plasticity engages mechanisms that change synapse structure and function, yet many of the underlying events bear a striking similarity to processes that occur during the initial establishment of neural circuits during development. It is a long-standing hypothesis that the molecular mechanisms critical for neural development may also regulate synaptic plasticity related to learning and memory in adults. Netrins were initially described as chemoattractant guidance cues that direct cell and axon migration during embryonic development, yet they continue to be expressed by neurons in the adult brain. Recent findings have identified roles for netrin-1 in synaptogenesis during postnatal maturation, and in synaptic plasticity in the adult mammalian brain, regulating AMPA glutamate receptor trafficking at excitatory synapses. These findings provide an example of a conserved developmental guidance cue that is expressed by neurons in the adult brain and functions as a key regulator of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Notably, in humans, genetic polymorphisms in netrin-1 and its receptors have been linked to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. The molecular mechanisms associated with the synaptic function of netrin-1 therefore present new therapeutic targets for neuropathologies associated with memory dysfunction. Here, we summarize recent findings that link netrin-1 signalling to synaptic plasticity, and discuss the implications of these discoveries for the neurobiological basis of memory consolidation.",NA,NA,NA
32161362,1,"APOEε4 is the most well-established genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease and is associated with cerebral amyloid-β. However, the association between APOEε4 and tau pathology, the other major proteinopathy of Alzheimer's disease, has been controversial. Here, we sought to determine whether the relationship between APOEε4 and tau pathology is determined by local interactions with amyloid-β. We examined three independent samples of cognitively unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease subjects: (1) 211 participants who underwent tau-PET with [18F]MK6240 and amyloid-PET with [18F]AZD4694, (2) 264 individuals who underwent tau-PET with [18F]Flortaucipir and amyloid-PET with [18F]Florbetapir and (3) 487 individuals who underwent lumbar puncture and amyloid-PET with [18F]Florbetapir. Using a novel analytical framework, we applied voxel-wise regression models to assess the interactive effect of APOEε4 and amyloid-β on tau load, independently of age and clinical diagnosis. We found that the interaction effect between APOEε4 and amyloid-β, rather than the sum of their independent effects, was related to increased tau load in Alzheimer's disease-vulnerable regions. The interaction between one APOEε4 allele and amyloid-β was related to increased tau load, while the interaction between amyloid-β and two APOEε4 alleles was related to a more widespread pattern of tau aggregation. Our results contribute to an emerging framework in which the elevated risk of developing dementia conferred by APOEε4 genotype involves mechanisms associated with both amyloid-β and tau aggregation. These results may have implications for future disease-modifying therapeutic trials targeting amyloid or tau pathologies.",NA,NA,NA

32203155,1,"Lithium is a first-line medication for bipolar disorder (BD), but only one in three patients respond optimally to the drug. Since evidence shows a strong clinical and genetic overlap between depression and bipolar disorder, we investigated whether a polygenic susceptibility to major depression is associated with response to lithium treatment in patients with BD. Weighted polygenic scores (PGSs) were computed for major depression (MD) at different GWAS p value thresholds using genetic data obtained from 2586 bipolar patients who received lithium treatment and took part in the Consortium on Lithium Genetics (ConLi+Gen) study. Summary statistics from genome-wide association studies in MD (135,458 cases and 344,901 controls) from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) were used for PGS weighting. Response to lithium treatment was defined by continuous scores and categorical outcome (responders versus non-responders) using measurements on the Alda scale. Associations between PGSs of MD and lithium treatment response were assessed using a linear and binary logistic regression modeling for the continuous and categorical outcomes, respectively. The analysis was performed for the entire cohort, and for European and Asian sub-samples. The PGSs for MD were significantly associated with lithium treatment response in multi-ethnic, European or Asian populations, at various p value thresholds. Bipolar patients with a low polygenic load for MD were more likely to respond well to lithium, compared to those patients with high polygenic load [lowest vs highest PGS quartiles, multi-ethnic sample: OR = 1.54 (95% CI: 1.18-2.01) and European sample: OR = 1.75 (95% CI: 1.30-2.36)]. While our analysis in the Asian sample found equivalent effect size in the same direction: OR = 1.71 (95% CI: 0.61-4.90), this was not statistically significant. Using PGS decile comparison, we found a similar trend of association between a high genetic loading for MD and lower response to lithium. Our findings underscore the genetic contribution to lithium response in BD and support the emerging concept of a lithium-responsive biotype in BD.",NA,NA,NA
32324064,1,"Objective: The purpose of the study was to identify profiles and predictors of academic and social functioning in a sample of school-age children with autism spectrum disorder.Method: The study included 178 children (88% boys, 75% Caucasian, ages 10-11) who completed a standardized measure of academic skills and whose teachers completed a related measure. Measures of both academic and social performance were used to construct profiles of school functioning. Measures of language, nonverbal IQ, autism symptom severity, behavior difficulties, and early social-communication skills between ages 3 and 4 were used to examine predictors of profile membership. Latent Profile Analysis was used to identify and describe profiles of children's academic and social school functioning. Profile membership was then regressed on each of the predictors using a series of multinomial logistic regression models. Finally, a multivariate model that included all significant predictors was built to examine the best fitting constellation of profile predictors.Results: Four profiles - reflecting variation in academic achievement, school engagement, socialization skills, pragmatic language use, and social relationships - captured the diverse school functioning outcomes of the sample. Profile membership was predicted by variation in imitation, responding to joint attention, language ability, nonverbal IQ and behavior difficulties between ages 3 and 4 years. However, in a multivariate model, only language and behavior difficulties emerged as significant predictors.Conclusions: A person-centered approach to targeted early intervention that reduces behavior difficulties and enhances social-communication and language abilities may prove especially important for the promotion of later academic and social functioning at school.",NA,NA,NA

32591633,1,"Neurofilament light chain (NFL) measurement has been gaining strong support as a clinically useful neuronal injury biomarker for various neurodegenerative conditions. However, in Alzheimer's disease (AD), its reflection on regional neuronal injury in the context of amyloid pathology remains unclear. This study included 83 cognitively normal (CN), 160 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 73 AD subjects who were further classified based on amyloid-beta (Aβ) status as positive or negative (Aβ+ vs Aβ-). In addition, 13 rats (5 wild type and 8 McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic (Tg)) were examined. In the clinical study, reduced precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex and hippocampal grey matter density were significantly associated with increased NFL concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or plasma in MCI Aβ+ and AD Aβ+. Moreover, AD Aβ+ showed a significant association between the reduced grey matter density in the AD-vulnerable regions and increased NFL concentrations in CSF or plasma. Congruently, Tg rats recapitulated and validated the association between CSF NFL and grey matter density in the parietotemporal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus in the presence of amyloid pathology. In conclusion, reduced grey matter density and elevated NFL concentrations in CSF and plasma are associated in AD-vulnerable regions in the presence of amyloid positivity in the AD clinical spectrum and amyloid Tg rat model. These findings further support the NFL as a neuronal injury biomarker in the research framework of AD biomarker classification and for the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials.",NA,NA,NA

32691490,1,"Understanding the rules that govern neuronal dynamics throughout the brain to subserve behavior and cognition remains one of the biggest challenges in neuroscience research. Recent technical advances enable the recording of increasingly larger neuronal populations to produce increasingly more sophisticated datasets.

Discrepancies between experimental protocols present key challenges in comparing data between laboratories and across different brain regions and species. Here, we discuss our recent efforts to create a standardized and high-throughput research platform to address these issues. The McGill-Mouse-Miniscope (M3) platform is an initiative to combine miniscope calcium imaging with standardized touchscreen-based animal behavioral testing. The goal is to curate an open-source and standardized framework for acquiring, analyzing, and accessing high-quality data of the neuronal dynamics that underly cognition throughout the brain in mice, marmosets, and models of disease.

32737243,1,"Amyloid-β deposition into plaques is a pathologic hallmark of Alzheimer disease appearing years before the onset of symptoms. Although cerebral amyloid-β deposition occurs on a continuum, dichotomization into positive and negative groups has advantages for diagnosis, clinical management, and population enrichment for clinical trials. 18F-AZD4694 (also known as 18F-NAV4694) is an amyloid-β imaging ligand with high affinity for amyloid-β plaques. Despite being used in multiple academic centers, no studies have assessed a quantitative cutoff for amyloid-β positivity using 18F-AZD4694 PET. Methods: We assessed 176 individuals [young adults (n = 22), cognitively unimpaired elderly (n = 89), and cognitively impaired (n = 65)] who underwent amyloid-β PET with 18F-AZD4694, lumbar puncture, structural MRI, and genotyping for APOEε4 18F-AZD4694 values were normalized using the cerebellar gray matter as a reference region. We compared 5 methods for deriving a quantitative threshold for 18F-AZD4694 PET positivity: comparison with young-control SUV ratios (SUVRs), receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves based on clinical classification of cognitively unimpaired elderly versus Alzheimer disease dementia, ROC curves based on visual Aβ-positive/Aβ-negative classification, gaussian mixture modeling, and comparison with cerebrospinal fluid measures of amyloid-β, specifically the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. Results: We observed good convergence among the 4 methods: ROC curves based on visual classification (optimal cut point, 1.55 SUVR), ROC curves based on clinical classification (optimal cut point, 1.56 SUVR) gaussian mixture modeling (optimal cut point, 1.55 SUVR), and comparison with cerebrospinal fluid measures of amyloid-β (optimal cut point, 1.51 SUVR). Means and 2 SDs from young controls resulted in a lower threshold (1.33 SUVR) that did not agree with the other methods and labeled most elderly individuals as Aβ-positive. Conclusion: Good convergence was obtained among several methods for determining an optimal cutoff for 18F-AZD4694 PET positivity. Despite conceptual and analytic idiosyncrasies linked with dichotomization of continuous variables, an 18F-AZD4694 threshold of 1.55 SUVR had reliable discriminative accuracy. Although clinical use of amyloid PET is currently by visual inspection of scans, quantitative thresholds may be helpful to arbitrate disagreement among raters or in borderline cases.",NA,NA,NA
32778006,1,"The American Neuropsychiatric Association's Committee on Research assigned the task of defining the most helpful clinical factors and tests in establishing the diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) during a neuropsychiatric assessment. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using three search engines and specified search terms for PNES and the predetermined clinical factors and diagnostic tests, followed by a selection process with specific criteria. Data extraction results from selected articles are presented for clinical factors (semiology, psychiatric comorbidities, medical comorbidities, psychological traits) and diagnostic tests (EEG, psychometric and neuropsychological measures, prolactin level, clinical neuroimaging, autonomic testing). Semiology with video EEG (vEEG) remains the most valuable tool to determine the diagnosis of PNES. With the exception of semiology, very few studies revealed the predictive value of a clinical factor for PNES, and such findings were isolated and not replicated in most cases. Induction techniques, especially when coupled with vEEG, can lead to a captured event, which then confirms the diagnosis. In the absence of a captured event, postevent prolactin level and personality assessment can support the diagnosis but need to be carefully contextualized with other clinical factors. A comprehensive clinical assessment in patients with suspected PNES can identify several clinical factors and may include a number of tests that can support the diagnosis of PNES. This is especially relevant when the gold standard of a captured event with typical semiology on vEEG cannot be obtained.",NA,NA,NA
32778007,1,"Functional neurological (conversion) disorder (FND) is a prevalent and disabling condition at the intersection of neurology and psychiatry. Advances have been made in elucidating an emerging pathophysiology for motor FND, as well as in identifying evidenced-based physiotherapy and psychotherapy treatments. Despite these gains, important elements of the initial neuropsychiatric assessment of functional movement disorders (FND-movt) and functional limb weakness/paresis (FND-par) have yet to be established. This is an important gap from both diagnostic and treatment planning perspectives. In this article, the authors performed a narrative review to characterize clinically relevant variables across FND-movt and FND-par cohorts, including time course and symptom evolution, precipitating factors, medical and family histories, psychiatric comorbidities, psychosocial factors, physical examination signs, and adjunctive diagnostic tests. Thereafter, the authors propose a preliminary set of clinical content that should be assessed during early-phase patient encounters, in addition to identifying physical signs informing diagnosis and potential use of adjunctive tests for challenging cases. Although clinical history should not be used to make a FND diagnosis, characteristics such as acute onset, precipitating events (e.g., injury and surgery), and a waxing and waning course (including spontaneous remissions) are commonly reported. Active psychiatric symptoms (e.g., depression and anxiety) and ongoing psychosocial stressors also warrant evaluation. Positive physical examination signs (e.g., Hoover's sign and tremor entrainment) are key findings, as one of the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. The neuropsychiatric assessment proposed emphasizes diagnosing FND by using ""rule-in"" physical signs while also considering psychiatric and psychosocial factors to aid in the development of a patient-centered treatment plan.",NA,NA,NA

We analyzed this effect in a new cohort of LRRK2 p.G2019S heterozygotes (n = 724) and meta-analyzed our data with previously published data (n = 754). VAMP4 is in close proximity to DNM3, and was associated with PD in a recent study, so it is possible that variants in this gene may be important. We also analyzed the effect of VAMP4 rs11578699 on LRRK2 penetrance. Our analysis of DNM3 in previously unpublished data does not show an effect on age at onset in LRRK2 p.G2019S carriers; however, the inter-study heterogeneity may indicate ethnic or population-specific effects of DNM3. There was no evidence for linkage disequilibrium between DNM3 and VAMP4. Analysis of sporadic patients stratified by the risk variant LRRK2 rs10878226 indicates a possible interaction between common variation in LRRK2 and VAMP4 in disease risk.",NA,NA,NA
32893416,1,"The genetics care pathway experienced by families affected by autism spectrum disorder (ASD) around the time of diagnosis is currently uncharacterized and potentially variable across contexts. The lack of consensus on outcome measures to capture the impact of genetic services for these families shows a gap in understanding and optimizing this genetics care pathway. The Genetic Counseling Outcome Scale (GCOS-24) is a validated outcome measure of clinical genetics services. The current study aims to adapt and validate the GCOS-24 as an outcome measure in the context routine genetic testing in ASD and related conditions. Families seen for their child's developmental evaluation for ASD and related conditions were invited to participate in a genomics cohort between 2016 and 2018. Families (n = 111) completed the mGCOS-24 (modified GCOS-24), adapted from the original GCOS-24 by clinicians working in the target population's routine care pathway. The mGCOS-24 has acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.84) and high test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.88). It also inversely correlates with stress as measured by Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and distress, as measured by the Distress Thermometer, rs ≥ 0.39, ps < 0.001. The mGCOS-24 had adequate readability, as supported by cognitive interviews completed by a sub-sample of five mothers of a child with ASD. Together, our findings show that the mGCOS-24 has good validity for the target population. Preliminary characterization of the genetics care pathway in this population revealed remarkable variability in pre-test counseling and limited post-test counseling. The use of the mGCOS-24 as an outcome measure is useful in filling some of these gaps by offering a way to assess, and in the future, optimize the genetics care pathway for families affected by autism and related neurodevelopmental conditions.",NA,NA,NA
32909238,1,"In contrast to cardiac sympathetic activity which can be assessed with established PET tracers, there are currently no suitable radioligands to measure cardiac parasympathetic (cholinergic) activity. A radioligand able to measure cardiac cholinergic activity would be an invaluable clinical and research tool since cholinergic dysfunction has been associated with a wide array of pathologies (e.g., chronic heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrythmias). [18F]Fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol (FEOBV) is a cholinergic radiotracer that has been extensively validated in the brain. Whether FEOBV PET can be used to assess cholinergic activity in the heart is not known. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the properties of FEOBV for cardiac PET imaging and cholinergic activity mapping. PET data were collected for 40 minutes after injection of 230 ± 50 MBq of FEOBV in four healthy participants (1 female; Age: 37 ± 10; BMI: 25 ± 2). Dynamic LV time activity curves were fitted with Logan graphical, 1-tissue compartment, and 2-tissue compartment models, yielding similar distribution volume estimates for each participant. Our initial data show that FEOBV PET has favorable tracer kinetics for quantification of cholinergic activity and is a promising new method for assessing parasympathetic function in the heart.",NA,NA,NA
32910475,1,"Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that produce energy and molecular precursors that are essential for myelin synthesis. Unlike in neurons, mitochondria in oligodendrocytes increase intracellular movement in response to glutamatergic activation and are more susceptible to oxidative stress than in astrocytes or microglia. The signaling pathways that regulate these cell type-specific mitochondrial responses in oligodendrocytes are not understood. Here, we visualized mitochondria migrating through thin cytoplasmic channels crossing myelin basic protein-positive compacted membranes and localized within paranodal loop cytoplasm. We hypothesized that local extracellular enrichment of netrin-1 might regulate the recruitment and function of paranodal proteins and organelles, including mitochondria. We identified rapid recruitment of mitochondria and paranodal proteins, including neurofascin 155 (NF155) and the netrin receptor deleted in colorectal carcinoma (DCC), to sites of contact between oligodendrocytes and netrin-1-coated microbeads in vitro. We provide evidence that Src-family kinase activation and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibition downstream of netrin-1 induces mitochondrial elongation, hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane, and increases glycolysis. Our findings identify a signaling mechanism in oligodendrocytes that is sufficient to locally recruit paranodal proteins and regulate the subcellular localization, morphology, and function of mitochondria.",NA,NA,NA

Autism susceptibility increases when deleting or duplicating any point of pLI. This is true for individuals with high or low IQ and after removing de novo and known recurrent neuropsychiatric CNVs. When CNV effects on IQ are accounted for, autism susceptibility remains mostly unchanged for duplications but decreases for deletions.

32969758,1,"To evaluate safety, dose response, and preliminary efficacy of reldesemtiv over 12 weeks in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Methods: Patients (≤2 years since diagnosis) with slow upright vital capacity (SVC) of ≥60% were randomized 1:1:1:1 to reldesemtiv 150, 300, or 450 mg twice daily (bid) or placebo; active treatment was 12 weeks with 4-week follow-up. Primary endpoint was change in percent predicted SVC at 12 weeks; secondary measures included ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) and muscle strength mega-score. Results: Patients (N = 458) were enrolled; 85% completed 12-week treatment. The primary analysis failed to reach statistical significance (p = 0.11); secondary endpoints showed no statistically significant effects (ALSFRS-R, p = 0.09; muscle strength mega-score, p = 0.31). Post hoc analyses pooling all active reldesemtiv-treated patients compared against placebo showed trends toward benefit in all endpoints (progression rate for SVC, ALSFRS-R, and muscle strength mega-score (nominal p values of 0.10, 0.01 and 0.20 respectively)). Reldesemtiv was well tolerated, with nausea and fatigue being the most common side effects. A dose-dependent decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate was noted, and transaminase elevations were seen in approximately 5% of patients. Both hepatic and renal abnormalities trended toward resolution after study drug discontinuation. Conclusions: Although the primary efficacy analysis did not demonstrate statistical significance, there were trends favoring reldesemtiv for all three endpoints, with effect sizes generally regarded as clinically important. Tolerability was good; modest hepatic and renal abnormalities were reversible. The impact of reldesemtiv on patients with ALS should be assessed in a pivotal Phase 3 trial.

33038538,1,"Human cognition is dynamic, alternating over time between externally-focused states and more abstract, often self-generated, patterns of thought. Although cognitive neuroscience has documented how networks anchor particular modes of brain function, mechanisms that describe transitions between distinct functional states remain poorly understood. Here, we examined how time-varying changes in brain function emerge within the constraints imposed by macroscale structural network organization. Studying a large cohort of healthy adults (n = 326), we capitalized on manifold learning techniques that identify low dimensional representations of structural connectome organization and we decomposed neurophysiological activity into distinct functional states and their transition patterns using Hidden Markov Models. Structural connectome organization predicted dynamic transitions anchored in sensorimotor systems and those between sensorimotor and transmodal states. Connectome topology analyses revealed that transitions involving sensorimotor states traversed short and intermediary distances and adhered strongly to communication mechanisms of network diffusion. Conversely, transitions between transmodal states involved spatially distributed hubs and increasingly engaged long-range routing. These findings establish that the structure of the cortex is optimized to allow neural states the freedom to vary between distinct modes of processing, and so provides a key insight into the neural mechanisms that give rise to the flexibility of human cognition.",NA,NA,NA
33045336,1,"The identification of community structure in graphs continues to attract great interest in several fields. Network neuroscience is particularly concerned with this problem considering the key roles communities play in brain processes and functionality. Most methods used for community detection in brain graphs are based on the maximization of a parameter-dependent modularity function that often obscures the physical meaning and hierarchical organization of the partitions of network nodes. In this work, we present a new method able to detect communities at different scales in a natural, unrestricted way. First, to obtain an estimation of the information flow in the network we release random walkers to freely move over it. The activity of the walkers is separated into oscillatory modes by using empirical mode decomposition. After grouping nodes by their co-occurrence at each time scale, k-modes clustering returns the desired partitions. Our algorithm was first tested on benchmark graphs with favorable performance. Next, it was applied to real and simulated anatomical and/or functional connectomes in the macaque and human brains. We found a clear hierarchical repertoire of community structures in both the anatomical and the functional networks. The observed partitions range from the evident division in two hemispheres -in which all processes are managed globally- to specialized communities seemingly shaped by physical proximity and shared function. Additionally, the spatial scales of a network's community structure (characterized by a measure we term within-communities path length) appear inversely proportional to the oscillatory modes' average frequencies. The proportionality constant may constitute a network-specific propagation velocity for the information flow. Our results stimulate the research of hierarchical community organization in terms of temporal scales of information flow in the brain network.",NA,NA,NA

We have shown, in the hemi-parkinsonian rat model of PD, that the selective serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists ondansetron and granisetron decreased the severity of established dyskinesia, and ondansetron even attenuated the development of dyskinesia. Here, we seek to confirm these favourable data on dyskinesia and to explore the effect of ondansetron on the severity of psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs) in the gold standard model of PD, the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned non-human primate. We first determined the pharmacokinetic profile of ondansetron in the marmoset. Subsequently, six MPTP-lesioned marmosets were administered l-DOPA chronically until they exhibited stable and reproducible dyskinesia and PLBs upon each administration of l-DOPA. On behavioural assessment days, ondansetron (0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered in conjunction with l-DOPA, and the severity of dyskinesia, PLBs and parkinsonism was evaluated. Ondansetron 0.1 mg/kg alleviated global dyskinesia severity by 73% (P < 0.0001) and decreased duration of on-time with disabling dyskinesia by 88% (P = 0.0491). Ondansetron 0.1 mg/kg reduced the severity of global PLBs by 80% (P < 0.0001) and suppressed on-time with disabling PLBs (P = 0.0213). Ondansetron enhanced the anti-parkinsonian action of l-DOPA, reducing global parkinsonism by 53% compared to l-DOPA (P = 0.0004).

33160048,1,"Serotonin (5-HT) is a common neurotransmitter in mammals, playing a central role in the regulation of various processes such as sleep, perception, cognitive and autonomic functions in the nervous system. Previous studies have demonstrated that 5-HT type 3 (5-HT3) receptors are expressed in either or both the substantia nigra (SN) and the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) in humans, marmosets, rats and Syrian hamsters. Here, we quantify the distribution of 5-HT3 receptors across these regions in the adult rat. Fluorescent immunohistochemistry was performed on sections of rat brain covering the entire rostro-caudal extent of the SN and DRN with antibodies specific to the 5-HT3A receptor subunit, as well as others targeting the monoaminergic markers tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and the 5-HT transporter (SERT). The number of 5-HT3A receptor-positive, TH-positive (n = 28,428 ± 888, Gundersen's m = 1 coefficient of error [CE] = 0.05) and SERT-positive (n = 12,852 ± 462, CE = 0.06) cells were estimated in both the SN and the DRN using stereology.

Furthermore, genotype rs53576 and prenatal maternal anxiety significantly interacted on right hippocampal volumes irrespective of sex. Higher maternal anxiety was associated both with larger hippocampal volumes in A-allele carriers than GG-homozygotes, and, though statistically weak, also with smaller right caudate volumes in GG-homozygotes than A-allele carriers.

Human brain sections and a nematode genetic model were also quantified for metal levels using mass spectrometry.",METHODS,NA,NA
33175142,3,"We found a significant enrichment for the BTBD9 risk genotype in the RLS affected group compared to control (p = 0.0252), consistent with previous literature. Serum (p = 0.0458 and p = 0.0139 for study cohorts 1 and 2, respectively) and brain (p = 0.0413) zinc levels were significantly elevated in the RLS patients versus control subjects.",RESULTS,NA,NA
33175142,4,"We show for the first time that serum and brain levels of zinc are elevated in RLS. Further, we confirm the BTBD9 genetic risk factor in a new population, although the zinc changes were not significantly associated with risk genotypes. Zinc and iron homeostasis are interrelated, and zinc biology impacts neurotransmitter systems previously linked to RLS. Given the modest albeit statistically significant increase in serum zinc of ~20%, and the lack of association with two known genetic risk factors, zinc may not represent a primary etiology for the syndrome. Further investigation into the pathogenetic role that zinc may play in restless legs syndrome is needed.",CONCLUSION,NA,NA
33186718,1,"Sleep deprivation leads to significant impairments in cognitive performance and changes to the interactions between large scale cortical networks, yet the hierarchical organization of cortical activity across states is still being explored. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess activations and connectivity during cognitive tasks in 20 healthy young adults, during three states: (i) following a normal night of sleep, (ii) following 24hr of total sleep deprivation, and (iii) after a morning recovery nap. Situating cortical activity during cognitive tasks along hierarchical organizing gradients based upon similarity of functional connectivity patterns, we found that regional variations in task-activations were captured by an axis differentiating areas involved in executive control from default mode regions and paralimbic cortex. After global signal regression, the range of functional differentiation along this axis at baseline was significantly related to decline in working memory performance (2-back task) following sleep deprivation, as well as the extent of recovery in performance following a nap. The relative positions of cortical regions within gradients did not significantly change across states, except for a lesser differentiation of the visual system and increased coupling of the posterior cingulate cortex with executive control areas after sleep deprivation. This was despite a widespread increase in the magnitude of functional connectivity across the cortex following sleep deprivation. Cortical gradients of functional differentiation thus appear relatively insensitive to state-dependent changes following sleep deprivation and recovery, suggesting that there are no large-scale changes in cortical functional organization across vigilance states. Certain features of particular gradient axes may be informative for the extent of decline in performance on more complex tasks following sleep deprivation, and could be beneficial over traditional voxel- or parcel-based approaches in identifying realtionships between state-dependent brain activity and behavior.",NA,NA,NA
33190333,1,"Whether neuronal populations exhibit zero-lag (in-phase or in-antiphase) functional connectivity is a fundamental question when conceptualizing communication between cell assemblies. It also has profound implications on how we assess such interactions. Given that the brain is a delayed network due to the finite conduction velocity of the electrical impulses traveling across its fibers, the existence of long-distance zero-lag functional connectivity may be considered improbable. However, in this study, using human intracranial recordings we demonstrate that most interhemispheric connectivity between homotopic cerebral regions is zero-lagged and that this type of connectivity is ubiquitous. Volume conduction can be safely discarded as a confounding factor since it is known to drop almost completely within short interelectrode distances (<20 mm) in intracranial recordings. This finding should guide future electrophysiological connectivity studies and highlight the importance of considering the role of zero-lag connectivity in our understanding of communication between cell assemblies.",NA,NA,NA

33226316,1,"The frontal lobes have long been implicated in inhibitory control, but a full understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains elusive. The stop-signal task has been widely used to probe instructed response inhibition in cognitive neuroscience. The processes involved have been modeled and related to putative brain substrates. However, there has been surprisingly little human lesion research using this task, with the few existing studies implicating different prefrontal regions. Here, we tested the effects of focal prefrontal damage on stop-signal task performance in a large sample of people with chronic focal damage affecting the frontal lobes (n = 42) and demographically matched healthy individuals (n = 60). Patients with damage to the left lateral, right lateral, dorsomedial, or ventromedial frontal lobe had slower stop-signal RT compared to healthy controls. There were systematic differences in the patterns of impairment across frontal subgroups: Those with damage to the left or right lateral and dorsomedial frontal lobes, but not those with ventromedial frontal damage, were slower than controls to ""go"" as well as to stop. These findings suggest that multiple prefrontal regions make necessary but distinct contributions to stop-signal task performance. As a consequence, stop-signal RT slowing is not strongly localizing within the frontal lobes.",NA,NA,NA
33230005,1,"The development of new analgesic drugs has been hampered by the inability to translate preclinical findings to humans. This failure is due in part to the weak connection between commonly used pain outcome measures in rodents and the clinical symptoms of chronic pain. Most rodent studies rely on the use of experimenter-evoked measures of pain and assess behavior under ethologically unnatural conditions, which limits the translational potential of preclinical research. Here, we addressed this problem by conducting an unbiased, prospective study of behavioral changes in mice within a natural homecage environment using conventional preclinical pain assays. Unexpectedly, we observed that cage-lid hanging, a species-specific elective behavior, was the only homecage behavior reliably impacted by pain assays. Noxious stimuli reduced hanging behavior in an intensity-dependent manner, and the reduction in hanging could be restored by analgesics. Finally, we developed an automated approach to assess hanging behavior. Collectively, our results indicate that the depression of hanging behavior is a novel, ethologically valid, and translationally relevant pain outcome measure in mice that could facilitate the study of pain and analgesic development.",ABSTRACT,NA,NA

33236784,1,"Drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) considerably affects patient health, cognition, and well-being, and disproportionally contributes to the overall burden of epilepsy. The most common DRE syndromes are temporal lobe epilepsy related to mesiotemporal sclerosis and extratemporal epilepsy related to cortical malformations. Both syndromes have been traditionally considered as ""focal,"" and most patients benefit from brain surgery for long-term seizure control. However, increasing evidence indicates that many DRE patients also present with widespread structural and functional network disruptions. These anomalies have been suggested to relate to cognitive impairment and prognosis, highlighting their importance for patient management. The advent of multimodal neuroimaging and formal methods to quantify complex systems has offered unprecedented ability to profile structural and functional brain networks in DRE patients. Here, we performed a systematic review on existing DRE network biomarker candidates and their contribution to three key application areas: (1) modeling of cognitive impairments, (2) localization of the surgical target, and (3) prediction of clinical and cognitive outcomes after surgery. Although network biomarkers hold promise for a range of clinical applications, translation of neuroimaging biomarkers to the patient's bedside has been challenged by a lack of clinical and prospective studies. We therefore close by highlighting conceptual and methodological strategies to improve the evaluation and accessibility of network biomarkers, and ultimately guide clinically actionable decisions.",NA,NA,NA
33239198,1,"Rare mutations in genes originally discovered in multigenerational families have been associated with increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). The involvement of rare variants in DNAJC13, UCHL1, HTRA2, GIGYF2, and EIF4G1 loci has been poorly studied or has produced conflicting results across cohorts. However, they are still being often referred to as ""PD genes"" and used in different models. To further elucidate the role of these 5 genes in PD, we fully sequenced them using molecular inversion probes in 2408 patients with PD and 3444 controls from 3 different cohorts. A total of 788 rare variants were identified across the 5 genes and 3 cohorts. Burden analyses and optimized sequence Kernel association tests revealed no significant association between any of the genes and PD after correction for multiple comparisons. Our results do not support an association of the 5 tested genes with PD. Combined with previous studies, it is unlikely that any of these genes plays an important role in PD.

33242952,1,"The generation of mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs) is implicated in a plethora of vital cell functions, from mitochondrial quality control to peroxisomal biogenesis. The discovery of distinct subtypes of MDVs has revealed the selective inclusion of mitochondrial cargo in response to varying stimuli. However, the true scope and variety of MDVs is currently unclear, and unbiased approaches have yet to be used to understand their biology. Furthermore, as mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases, it is essential to understand MDV pathways in the nervous system. To address this, we sought to identify the cargo in brain MDVs. We used an in vitro budding assay and proteomic approach to identify proteins selectively enriched in MDVs. 72 proteins were identified as MDV-enriched, of which 31% were OXPHOS proteins. Interestingly, the OXPHOS proteins localized to specific modules of the respiratory complexes, hinting at the inclusion of sub-assemblies in MDVs. Small TIM chaperones were also highly enriched in MDVs, linking mitochondrial chaperone-mediated protein transport to MDV formation. As the two Parkinson's disease genes PINK1 and Parkin have been previously implicated in MDV biogenesis in response to oxidative stress, we compared the MDV proteomes from the brains of wild-type mice with those of PINK1-/- and Parkin-/- mice. No significant difference was found, suggesting that PINK1- and Parkin-dependent MDVs make up a small proportion of all MDVs in the brain.

33257954,1,"Negative symptoms such as anhedonia and apathy are among the most debilitating manifestations of schizophrenia (SZ). Imaging studies have linked these symptoms to morphometric abnormalities in 2 brain regions implicated in reward and motivation: the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and striatum. Higher negative symptoms are generally associated with reduced OFC thickness, while higher apathy specifically maps to reduced striatal volume. However, it remains unclear whether these tissue losses are a consequence of chronic illness and its treatment or an underlying phenotypic trait. Here, we use multicentre magnetic resonance imaging data to investigate orbitofrontal-striatal abnormalities across the SZ spectrum from healthy populations with high schizotypy to unmedicated and medicated first-episode psychosis (FEP), and patients with chronic SZ. Putamen, caudate, accumbens volume, and OFC thickness were estimated from T1-weighted images acquired in all 3 diagnostic groups and controls from 4 sites (n = 337). Results were first established in 1 discovery dataset and replicated in 3 independent samples. There was a negative correlation between apathy and putamen/accumbens volume only in healthy individuals with schizotypy; however, medicated patients exhibited larger putamen volume, which appears to be a consequence of antipsychotic medications. The negative association between reduced OFC thickness and total negative symptoms also appeared to vary along the SZ spectrum, being significant only in FEP patients. In schizotypy, there was increased OFC thickness relative to controls. Our findings suggest that negative symptoms are associated with a temporal continuum of orbitofrontal-striatal abnormalities that may predate the occurrence of SZ. Thicker OFC in schizotypy may represent either compensatory or pathological mechanisms prior to the disease onset.",NA,NA,NA

These pathways originate with populations of direction-selective neurons in the primary visual cortex, which projects to dorsal structures like the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas. Anatomical and imaging studies have suggested that area V3A might also be specialized for motion processing, but there have been very few studies of single-neuron direction selectivity in this area. We have therefore performed electrophysiological recordings from V3A neurons in two macaque monkeys (one male and one female) and measured responses to a large battery of motion stimuli that includes translation motion, as well as more complex optic flow patterns. For comparison, we simultaneously recorded the responses of MT neurons to the same stimuli. Surprisingly, we find that overall levels of direction selectivity are similar in V3A and MT and moreover that the population of V3A neurons exhibits somewhat greater selectivity for optic flow patterns.

Second, the short duration connections were observed for high-degree nodes in the visual and default networks, as well as in the hippocampus. Specifically, the connectivity profile of the highest-degree nodes was dominated by efferent connections to multiple cortical areas. Moderate high-degree nodes, particularly in hippocampal regions, showed an afferent connectivity profile. Finally, multimodal association nodes in lateral prefrontal brain regions demonstrated a short duration, bidirectional connectivity profile, consistent with this region's role in integrative and modulatory processing. These results provide novel insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of human brain function.",NA,NA,NA

33338829,2,Two post-hoc pooled data analyses were performed: one from three Phase III studies in patients with focal (partial-onset) seizures who were taking 1-3 concomitant ASDs; the other from five Phase II studies in patients from non-epilepsy populations not taking other ASDs chronically and/or at a clinically-effective anti-seizure dose. The frequencies of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were calculated for the older (≥60 years) and younger (18-59 years) adults separately.,METHODS,NA,NA
33338829,3,"In the focal seizures study pool, 4.1 % of patients (58/1431) were aged ≥60 years. The overall frequency of TEAEs was 77.5 % in older ESL-treated patients and 72.6 % in younger ESL-treated patients (p = 0.495). For patients who received placebo, the overall frequency of TEAEs was 50.0 % in the older adults and 57.5 % in the younger adults (p = 0.531). The overall placebo-adjusted frequency of TEAEs was 27.5 % in older adults and 15.1 % in younger adults. The placebo-adjusted frequencies of the TEAEs dizziness, somnolence, headache, nausea, diplopia, blurred vision, and ataxia were ≥5 % higher, and frequencies of vomiting and vertigo were ≥2 % higher in older than younger adults. The overall frequency of TEAEs leading to discontinuation was 15.0 % in older ESL-treated patients and 17.6 % in younger ESL-treated patients (p = 0.647); the frequency increased with increasing ESL dose. For patients who received placebo, the overall frequency of TEAEs leading to discontinuation was 5.6 % in older adults and 6.6 % in younger adults (p = 0.847). In the non-epilepsy study pool, 30.2 % of patients (515/1705) were aged ≥60 years. The overall frequency of TEAEs was 56.9 % in older ESL-treated patients and 58.8 % in younger ESL-treated patients.

However, in the non-epilepsy patient group (in which the number of older patients was ten times larger; 427 patients taking ESL without concomitant ASDs), no marked age-related TEAE differences were observed, suggesting that increased ASD load associated with adjunctive therapy may complicate treatment selection in older patients, due to risk of increased adverse events. As is common practice for all ASDs, balancing clinical response and tolerability is needed in this vulnerable group of patients.",CONCLUSION,NA,NA
33349842,1,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous loci associated with Parkinson's disease. The specific genes and variants that drive the associations within the vast majority of these loci are unknown. We aimed to perform a comprehensive analysis of selected genes to determine the potential role of rare and common genetic variants within these loci. We fully sequenced 32 genes from 25 loci previously associated with Parkinson's disease in 2657 patients and 3647 controls from three cohorts. Capture was done using molecular inversion probes targeting the exons, exon-intron boundaries and untranslated regions (UTRs) of the genes of interest, followed by sequencing. Quality control was performed to include only high-quality variants. We examined the role of rare variants (minor allele frequency < 0.01) using optimized sequence Kernel association tests. The association of common variants was estimated using regression models adjusted for age, sex and ethnicity as required in each cohort, followed by a meta-analysis. After Bonferroni correction, we identified a burden of rare variants in SYT11, FGF20 and GCH1 associated with Parkinson's disease. Nominal associations were identified in 21 additional genes. Previous reports suggested that the SYT11 GWAS association is driven by variants in the nearby GBA gene. However, the association of SYT11 was mainly driven by a rare 3' UTR variant (rs945006601) and was independent of GBA variants (P = 5.23 × 10-5 after exclusion of all GBA variant carriers). The association of FGF20 was driven by a rare 5' UTR variant (rs1034608171) located in the promoter region. The previously reported association of GCH1 with Parkinson's disease is driven by rare non-synonymous variants, some of which are known to cause dopamine-responsive dystonia. We also identified two LRRK2 variants, p.Arg793Met and p.Gln1353Lys, in 10 and eight controls, respectively, but not in patients. We identified common variants associated with Parkinson's disease in MAPT, TMEM175, BST1, SNCA and GPNMB, which are all in strong linkage disequilibrium with known GWAS hits in their respective loci. A common coding PM20D1 variant, p.Ile149Val, was nominally associated with reduced risk of Parkinson's disease (odds ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.60-0.89, P = 1.161 × 10-3). This variant is not in linkage disequilibrium with the top GWAS hits within this locus and may represent a novel association. These results further demonstrate the importance of fine mapping of GWAS loci, and suggest that SYT11, FGF20, and potentially PM20D1, BST1 and GPNMB should be considered for future studies as possible Parkinson's disease-related genes.",NA,NA,NA
33355695,1,"There is a long-established link between anatomy and function in the somatomotor system in the mammalian cerebral cortex. The morphology of the central sulcus is predictive of the location of functional activation peaks relating to movement of different effectors in individuals. By contrast, morphological variation in the subcentral region and its relationship to function is, as yet, unknown. Investigating the subcentral region is particularly important in the context of speech, since control of the larynx during human speech production is related to activity in this region. Here, we examined the relationship between morphology in the central and subcentral region and the location of functional activity during movement of the hand, lips, tongue, and larynx at the individual participant level. We provide a systematic description of the sulcal patterns of the subcentral and adjacent opercular cortex, including the inter-individual variability in sulcal morphology. We show that, in the majority of participants, the anterior subcentral sulcus is not continuous, but consists of two distinct segments. A robust relationship between morphology of the central and subcentral sulcal segments and movement of different effectors is demonstrated. Inter-individual variability of underlying anatomy might thus explain previous inconsistent findings, in particular regarding the ventral larynx area in subcentral cortex. A surface registration based on sulcal labels indicated that such anatomical information can improve the alignment of functional data for group studies.",NA,NA,NA

33359339,1,"Electroencephalographic (EEG) source reconstruction is a powerful approach that allows anatomical localization of electrophysiological brain activity. Algorithms used to estimate cortical sources require an anatomical model of the head and the brain, generally reconstructed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). When such scans are unavailable, a population average can be used for adults, but no average surface template is available for cortical source imaging in infants. To address this issue, we introduce a new series of 13 anatomical models for subjects between zero and 24 months of age. These templates are built from MRI averages and boundary element method (BEM) segmentation of head tissues available as part of the Neurodevelopmental MRI Database. Surfaces separating the pia mater, the gray matter, and the white matter were estimated using the Infant FreeSurfer pipeline. The surface of the skin as well as the outer and inner skull surfaces were extracted using a cube marching algorithm followed by Laplacian smoothing and mesh decimation. We post-processed these meshes to correct topological errors and ensure watertight meshes. Source reconstruction with these templates is demonstrated and validated using 100 high-density EEG recordings from 7-month-old infants. Hopefully, these templates will support future studies on EEG-based neuroimaging and functional connectivity in healthy infants as well as in clinical pediatric populations.",NA,NA,NA

Cyberball, a game where a ball is virtually tossed between players, then leads to the exclusion of the research participant, is a common method used to examine the experience of social exclusion. The neural correlates of social exclusion remain a topic of debate, particularly with regards to the role of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the concept of social pain. Here we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis using activation likelihood estimation (ALE) to identify brain activity reliably engaged by social exclusion during Cyberball task performance (Studies = 53; total N = 1,817 participants). Results revealed consistent recruitment in ventral anterior cingulate and posterior cingulate cortex, inferior and superior frontal gyri, posterior insula, and occipital pole. No reliable activity was observed in dACC. Using a probabilistic atlas to define dACC, fewer than 15% of studies reported peak coordinates in dACC. Meta-analytic connectivity mapping suggests patterns of co-activation are consistent with the topography of the default network. Reverse inference for cognition associated with reliable Cyberball activity computed in Neurosynth revealed social exclusion to be associated with cognitive terms Social, Autobiographical, Mental States, and Theory of Mind. Taken together, these findings highlight the role of the default network in social exclusion and warns against interpretations of the dACC as a key region involved in the experience of social exclusion in humans.",NA,NA,NA

33361257,1,"Identifying a structural brain lesion on MRI has important implications in epilepsy and is the most important factor that correlates with seizure freedom after surgery in patients with drug-resistant focal onset epilepsy. However, at conventional magnetic field strengths (1.5 and 3T), only approximately 60%-85% of MRI examinations reveal such lesions. Over the last decade, studies have demonstrated the added value of 7T MRI in patients with and without known epileptogenic lesions from 1.5 and/or 3T. However, translation of 7T MRI to clinical practice is still challenging, particularly in centers new to 7T, and there is a need for practical recommendations on targeted use of 7T MRI in the clinical management of patients with epilepsy.

Cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar structures, organized with different network patterns, underlying the pathophysiological substrates of genetic associated epilepsy with GTCS (GE-GTCS) and focal epilepsy associated with focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure (FE-FBTS). Structural covariance analysis can delineate the features of epilepsy network related with long-term effects from seizure. Morphometric MRI data of 111 patients with GE-GTCS, 111 patients with FE-FBTS and 111 healthy controls were studied. Cortico-striato-thalao-cerebellar networks of structural covariance within the gray matter were constructed using a Winner-take-all strategy with five cortical parcellations. Comparisons of structural covariance networks were conducted using permutation tests, and module effects of disease duration on networks were conducted using GLM model. Both patient groups showed increased connectivity of structural covariance relative to controls, mainly within the striatum and thalamus, and mostly correlated with the frontal, motor, and somatosensory cortices. Connectivity changes increased as a function of epilepsy durations. FE-FBTS showed more intensive and extensive gray matter changes with volumetric loss and connectivity increment than GE-GTCS.

To this day, few treatment options are available for each of these phenomena, and they are at times not effective or elicit adverse events, leaving some patients short of therapeutic options. We have recently shown that positive allosteric modulation of metabotropic 2 (mGlu2) receptors with the prototypical positive allosteric modulator (PAM) LY-487,379 is efficacious at alleviating both dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs), while simultaneously enhancing the anti-parkinsonian action of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned marmoset. Here, we assessed the effects of CBiPES, a mGlu2 PAM derived from LY-487,379, but with improved pharmacokinetic properties. Six MPTP-lesioned marmosets with reproducible dyskinesia and PLBs were administered L-DOPA in combination with vehicle or CBiPES (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg), after which their behaviour was rated. CBiPES 10 mg/kg reduced global dyskinesia by 60% (P < 0.0001), while peak dose dyskinesia was reduced by 66% (P < 0.001), compared to L-DOPA/vehicle.

However, long-term L-DOPA therapy is often marred by complications such as dyskinesia. We have previously demonstrated that serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) receptor blockade with the clinically available and highly selective antagonist ondansetron alleviates dyskinesia in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rat. Here, we sought to explore the antidyskinetic efficacy of granisetron, another clinically available 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. Rats were rendered hemi-parkinsonian by 6-OHDA injection in the medial forebrain bundle. Following induction of stable abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs), granisetron (0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg) or vehicle was acutely administered in combination with L-DOPA and the severity of AIMs, both duration and amplitude, was determined. We also assessed the effect of granisetron on L-DOPA antiparkinsonian action by performing the cylinder test. Adding granisetron (0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg) to L-DOPA resulted in a significant reduction of AIMs duration and amplitude, with certain parameters being reduced by as much as 38 and 45% (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively). The antidyskinetic effect of granisetron was not accompanied by a reduction of L-DOPA antiparkinsonian action.

Undirected graphs were constructed for the entire cortex in 17 FCD patients and 33 healthy controls using inter-regional similarity of [11C]ABP688 BPND. We assessed group differences in network integration between healthy controls and the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres of FCD patients. Compared to healthy controls, FCD patients showed reduced network efficiency and reduced small-world connectivity. The mGluR5 network of FCD patients was also less resilient to targeted removal of high centrality nodes, suggesting a less integrated network organization. In highly efficient hub nodes of FCD patients, we observed a significant negative correlation between local efficiency and duration of epilepsy only in the contralateral hemisphere, suggesting that some nodes may be more vulnerable to persistent epileptic activity. Our study provides the first in vivo evidence for a widespread reduction in cortical mGluR5 network integration in FCD patients.

Our study aimed to estimate the feasibility and efficacy potential of a 12-week aerobic and resistance training program on cognitive and physical performance outcomes. This is an externally controlled, two time-point, feasibility study within a larger study using a cohort multiple randomized controlled design yielding 3 groups: intervention group; comparison group and refusers. The intervention consisted of high-intensity interval training and resistance exercises 3 days/week. Specific feasibility and brain health outcomes were evaluated. Cognitive ability was ascertained by the Brief Cognitive Ability Measure (B-CAM) in all three groups. Standardized tests of physical performance were performed in the intervention group. Effect size, 95% confidence intervals, responder status analyses and reliable change indices were computed. Adherence to the intervention schedule and acceptability outcomes were good. There was no reliable change on B-CAM in the exercise group. Most physical performance measures benefited from the exercise training (effect sizes: 0.2 - 1.5). Although the 12-week exercise program improved physical capacity, it did not yield gains in cognitive ability in HIV. Further research is required to determine the exercise parameters that could benefit cognition.",NA,NA,NA
33402689,1,"Individuals with Parkinson's disease present with a complex clinical phenotype, encompassing sleep, motor, cognitive, and affective disturbances. However, characterizations of PD are typically made for the ""average"" patient, ignoring patient heterogeneity and obscuring important individual differences. Modern large-scale data sharing efforts provide a unique opportunity to precisely investigate individual patient characteristics, but there exists no analytic framework for comprehensively integrating data modalities. Here we apply an unsupervised learning method-similarity network fusion-to objectively integrate MRI morphometry, dopamine active transporter binding, protein assays, and clinical measurements from n = 186 individuals with de novo Parkinson's disease from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. We show that multimodal fusion captures inter-dependencies among data modalities that would otherwise be overlooked by field standard techniques like data concatenation. We then examine how patient subgroups derived from the fused data map onto clinical phenotypes, and how neuroimaging data is critical to this delineation. Finally, we identify a compact set of phenotypic axes that span the patient population, demonstrating that this continuous, low-dimensional projection of individual patients presents a more parsimonious representation of heterogeneity in the sample compared to discrete biotypes. Altogether, these findings showcase the potential of similarity network fusion for combining multimodal data in heterogeneous patient populations.",NA,NA,NA

33404617,5,"Of 232 patients with FTD, 115 (49.6%) had a C9orf72 expansion (median [interquartile range (IQR)] age at evaluation, 64.3 [57.5-69.7] years; 72 men [62.6%]; 115 White patients [100%]), 78 (33.6%) had a GRN variant (median [IQR] age, 63.4 [58.3-68.8] years; 40 women [51.3%]; 77 White patients [98.7%]), and 39 (16.8%) had a MAPT variant (median [IQR] age, 56.3 [49.9-62.4] years; 25 men [64.1%]; 37 White patients [94.9%]). All core behavioral symptoms, including disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, perseverative behavior, and hyperorality, were highly expressed in all gene variant carriers (>50% patients), with apathy being one of the most common and severe symptoms throughout the disease course (51.7%-100% of patients). Patients with MAPT variants showed the highest frequency and severity of most behavioral symptoms, particularly disinhibition (79.3%-100% of patients) and compulsive behavior (64.3%-100% of patients), compared with C9orf72 carriers (51.7%-95.8% of patients with disinhibition and 34.5%-75.0% with compulsive behavior) and GRN carriers (38.2%-100% with disinhibition and 20.6%-100% with compulsive behavior). Alongside behavioral symptoms, neuropsychiatric symptoms were very frequently reported in patients with genetic FTD: anxiety and depression were most common in GRN carriers (23.8%-100% of patients) and MAPT carriers (26.1%-77.8% of patients); hallucinations, particularly auditory and visual, were most common in C9orf72 carriers (10.3%-54.5% of patients).

33418170,1,"Mutations in the granulin gene (GRN) cause familial frontotemporal dementia. Understanding the structural brain changes in presymptomatic GRN carriers would enforce the use of neuroimaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and monitoring. We studied 100 presymptomatic GRN mutation carriers and 94 noncarriers from the Genetic Frontotemporal dementia initiative (GENFI), with MRI structural images. We analyzed 3T MRI structural images using the FreeSurfer pipeline to calculate the whole brain cortical thickness (CTh) for each subject. We also perform a vertex-wise general linear model to assess differences between groups in the relationship between CTh and diverse covariables as gender, age, the estimated years to onset and education. We also explored differences according to TMEM106B genotype, a possible disease modifier. Whole brain CTh did not differ between carriers and noncarriers. Both groups showed age-related cortical thinning. The group-by-age interaction analysis showed that this age-related cortical thinning was significantly greater in GRN carriers in the left superior frontal cortex. TMEM106B did not significantly influence the age-related cortical thinning.

The development of biomarkers to help in earlier, presymptomatic diagnosis could facilitate earlier identification and therefore earlier intervention and may lead to better outcomes, as well as providing information to help better understand the underlying mechanisms of ASD. In this study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of infants at high familial risk, from the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS), at 6, 12 and 24 months of age were included in a morphological analysis, fitting a mixed-effects model to Tensor Based Morphometry (TBM) results to obtain voxel-wise growth trajectories. Subjects were grouped by familial risk and clinical diagnosis at 2 years of age. Several regions, including the posterior cingulate gyrus, the cingulum, the fusiform gyrus, and the precentral gyrus, showed a significant effect for the interaction of group and age associated with ASD, either as an increased or a decreased growth rate of the cerebrum. In general, our results showed increased growth rate within white matter with decreased growth rate found mostly in grey matter. Overall, the regions showing increased growth rate were larger and more numerous than those with decreased growth rate.

33428113,1,"Fibromyalgia (FM) is a generalized chronic pain condition whose pathophysiology is poorly understood, and both basic and translational research are needed to advance the field. Here we used the Sluka model to test whether FM-like pain in mice would produce detectable brain modifications using resting-state (rs) functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Mice received intramuscular acid saline treatment, images were acquired at 7 T 5 days post-treatment, and pain thresholds tested 3 weeks post-scanning. Data-driven Independent Component Analysis revealed significant reduction of functional connectivity (FC) across several component pairs, with major changes for the Retrosplenial cortex (RSP) central to the default mode network, and to a lesser extent the Periaqueductal gray (PAG), a key pain processing area. Seed-to-seed analysis focused on 14 pain-related areas showed strongest FC reduction for RSP with several cortical areas (somatosensory, prefrontal and insular), and for PAG with both cortical (somatosensory) and subcortical (habenula, thalamus, parabrachial nucleus) areas. RSP-PAG FC was also reduced, and this decreased FC tended to be positively correlated with pain levels at individual subject level. Finally, seed-voxelwise analysis focused on PAG confirmed seed-to-seed findings and, also detected reduced PAG FC with the anterior cingulate cortex, increasingly studied in aversive pain effects. In conclusion, FM-like pain triggers FC alterations in the mouse, which are detected by rs-fMRI and are reminiscent of some human findings. The study reveals the causal fingerprint of FM-like pain in rodents, and indicates that both RSP and PAG connectional patterns could be suitable biomarkers, with mechanistic and translational value, for further investigations.",NA,NA,NA

We hypothesized that patients with ""exemplary phenotypes""-those whose clinical features are reliably associated with LiR and non-response (LiNR)-are more genetically separable than those with less exemplary phenotypes. Using clinical data collected from people with BD (n = 1266 across 7 centers; 34.7% responders), we computed a ""clinical exemplar score,"" which measures the degree to which a subject's clinical phenotype is reliably predictive of LiR/LiNR. For patients whose genotypes were available (n = 321), we evaluated whether a subgroup of responders/non-responders with the top 25% of clinical exemplar scores (the ""best clinical exemplars"") were more accurately classified based on genetic data, compared to a subgroup with the lowest 25% of clinical exemplar scores (the ""poor clinical exemplars""). On average, the best clinical exemplars of LiR had a later illness onset, completely episodic clinical course, absence of rapid cycling and psychosis, and few psychiatric comorbidities. The best clinical exemplars of LiR and LiNR were genetically separable with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 (IQR [0.83, 0.98]), compared to 0.66 [0.61, 0.80] (p = 0.0032) among poor clinical exemplars.

33440196,1,"Neuroimaging studies have shown that, despite the abstractness of music, it may mimic biologically rewarding stimuli (e.g., food) in its ability to engage the brain's reward circuitry. However, due to the lack of research comparing music and other types of reward, it is unclear to what extent the recruitment of reward-related structures overlaps among domains. To achieve this goal, we performed a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 38 neuroimaging studies (703 subjects) comparing the brain responses specifically to music and food-induced pleasure. Both engaged a common set of brain regions, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, and insula. Yet, comparative analyses indicated a partial dissociation in the engagement of the reward circuitry as a function of the type of reward, as well as additional reward type-specific activations in brain regions related to perception, sensory processing, and learning. These results support the idea that hedonic reactions rely on the engagement of a common reward network, yet through specific routes of access depending on the modality and nature of the reward.",NA,NA,NA
33441015,1,"The behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is the second most common cause of dementia for individuals <65 years old, but accurate diagnosis is often delayed for several years. While previous criteria have increased the ability of diagnosticians to distinguish between bvFTD and other neurocognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, distinguishing bvFTD from a primary psychiatric disorder (PPD) has been more challenging. In early 2020, the Neuropsychiatric International Consortium for Frontotemporal Dementia published the first consensus recommendations to help clinicians distinguish between bvFTD and PPD. These recommendations were produced by a consortium of 45 scientists and clinicians from more than 15 different countries, who explored aspects of history taking, neuropsychological assessments, clinical scales, neuroimaging, CSF and serum biomarkers, and genetics. A multidisciplinary approach is encouraged throughout. In this article, the authors also review those consensus recommendations and highlight use of novel tests and techniques.

33441847,1,"Predicting lithium response prior to treatment could both expedite therapy and avoid exposure to side effects. Since lithium responsiveness may be heritable, its predictability based on genomic data is of interest. We thus evaluate the degree to which lithium response can be predicted with a machine learning (ML) approach using genomic data. Using the largest existing genomic dataset in the lithium response literature (n = 2210 across 14 international sites; 29% responders), we evaluated the degree to which lithium response could be predicted based on 47,465 genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms using a supervised ML approach. Under appropriate cross-validation procedures, lithium response could be predicted to above-chance levels in two constituent sites (Halifax, Cohen's kappa 0.15, 95% confidence interval, CI [0.07, 0.24]; and Würzburg, kappa 0.2 [0.1, 0.3]). Variants with shared importance in these models showed over-representation of postsynaptic membrane related genes. Lithium response was not predictable in the pooled dataset (kappa 0.02 [- 0.01, 0.04]), although non-trivial performance was achieved within a restricted dataset including only those patients followed prospectively (kappa 0.09 [0.04, 0.14]).

33443570,1,"Glioblastoma is the most common and deadly malignant brain cancer. We now demonstrate that loss of function of the endosomal GTPase Rab35 in human brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs) increases glioblastoma growth and decreases animal survival following BTIC implantation in mouse brains. Mechanistically, we identify that the GTPase Arf5 interacts with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab35, DENND1/connecdenn, and allosterically enhances its GEF activity toward Rab35. Knockdown of either Rab35 or Arf5 increases cell migration, invasiveness, and self-renewal in culture and enhances the growth and invasiveness of BTIC-initiated brain tumors in mice. RNAseq of the tumors reveals up-regulation of the tumor-promoting transcription factor SPOCD1, and disruption of the Arf5/Rab35 axis in glioblastoma cells leads to strong activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor, with resulting enhancement of SPOCD1 levels. These discoveries reveal an unexpected cascade between an Arf and a Rab and indicate a role for the cascade, and thus endosomal trafficking, in brain tumors.",NA,NA,NA

In social neuroscience, many experiments have sought to first define and then locate 'perspective taking', 'empathy', and other psychological concepts to specific brain circuits. Seldom, bottom-up studies were conducted to first identify explanatory patterns of brain variation, which are then related to psychological concepts; perhaps due to a lack of large population datasets. In this spirit, we performed a systematic de-construction of social brain morphology into its elementary building blocks, involving ~10,000 UK Biobank participants. We explored coherent representations of structural co-variation at population scale within a recent social brain atlas, by translating autoencoder neural networks from deep learning. The learned subnetworks revealed essential patterns of structural relationships between social brain regions, with the nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex, and temporoparietal junction embedded at the core. Some of the uncovered subnetworks contributed to predicting examined social traits in general, while other subnetworks helped predict specific facets of social functioning, such as the experience of social isolation. As a consequence of our population-level evidence, spatially overlapping subsystems of the social brain probably relate to interindividual differences in everyday social life.",NA,NA,NA
33447847,1,"Individual differences in sulcal variation within the anterior and mid-cingulate cortex of the human brain, particularly the presence or absence of a paracingulate sulcus (PCGS), are associated with various motor and cognitive processes. Recently, it has been reported that chimpanzees possess a PCGS, previously thought to be a unique feature of the human brain. Here, we examined whether individual variation in the presence or absence of a PCGS as well as the variability in the intralimbic sulcus (ILS) are associated with oro-facial motor control, handedness for manual gestures, and sex in a sample of MRI scans obtained in 225 chimpanzees. Additionally, we quantified the depth of the cingulate sulcus (CGS) along the anterior-posterior axis and tested for association with oro-facial motor control, handedness, and sex. Chimpanzees with better oro-facial motor control were more likely to have a PCGS, particularly in the left hemisphere compared to those with poorer control. Male chimpanzees with better oro-facial motor control showed increased leftward asymmetries in the depth of the anterior CGS, whereas female chimpanzees showed the opposite pattern. Significantly, more chimpanzees had an ILS in the left compared to the right hemisphere, but variability in this fold was not associated with sex, handedness, or oro-facial motor control. Finally, significant population-level leftward asymmetries were found in the anterior portion of the CGS, whereas significant rightward biases were evident in the posterior regions. The collective results suggest that the emergence of a PCGS and enhanced gyrification within the anterior and mid-cingulate gyrus may have directly or indirectly evolved in response to selection for increasing oro-facial motor control in primates.",NA,NA,NA

33462189,1,"Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neuropsychiatric disorder of complex genetic architecture involving multiple interacting genes. Here, we sought to elucidate the pathways that underlie the neurobiology of the disorder through genome-wide analysis. We analyzed genome-wide genotypic data of 3581 individuals with TS and 7682 ancestry-matched controls and investigated associations of TS with sets of genes that are expressed in particular cell types and operate in specific neuronal and glial functions. We employed a self-contained, set-based association method (SBA) as well as a competitive gene set method (MAGMA) using individual-level genotype data to perform a comprehensive investigation of the biological background of TS. Our SBA analysis identified three significant gene sets after Bonferroni correction, implicating ligand-gated ion channel signaling, lymphocytic, and cell adhesion and transsynaptic signaling processes. MAGMA analysis further supported the involvement of the cell adhesion and trans-synaptic signaling gene set. The lymphocytic gene set was driven by variants in FLT3, raising an intriguing hypothesis for the involvement of a neuroinflammatory element in TS pathogenesis. The indications of involvement of ligand-gated ion channel signaling reinforce the role of GABA in TS, while the association of cell adhesion and trans-synaptic signaling gene set provides additional support for the role of adhesion molecules in neuropsychiatric disorders. This study reinforces previous findings but also provides new insights into the neurobiology of TS.",NA,NA,NA
33474577,1,"Resting state functional connectivity research has shown that general cognitive ability (GCA) is associated with brain resilience to targeted and random attacks (TAs and RAs). However, it remains to be seen if the finding generalizes to structural connectivity. Furthermore, individuals showing performance levels at the very high area of the GCA distribution have not yet been analyzed in this regard. Here we study the relation between TAs and RAs to structural brain networks and GCA. Structural and diffusion-weighted MRI brain images were collected from 189 participants: 60 high cognitive ability (HCA) and 129 average cognitive ability (ACA) individuals. All participants completed a standardized fluid reasoning ability test and the results revealed an average HCA-ACA difference equivalent to 33 IQ points. Automated parcellation of cortical and subcortical nodes was combined with tractography to achieve an 82 × 82 connectivity matrix for each subject. Graph metrics were derived from the structural connectivity matrices. A simulation approach was used to evaluate the effects of recursively removing nodes according to their network centrality (TAs) versus eliminating nodes at random (RAs). HCA individuals showed greater network integrity at baseline and prior to network collapse than ACA individuals. These effects were more evident for TAs than RAs. The networks of HCA individuals were less degraded by the removal of nodes corresponding to more complex information processing stages of the PFIT network, and from removing nodes with larger empirically observed centrality values. Analyzed network features suggest quantitative instead of qualitative differences at different levels of the cognitive ability distribution.",NA,NA,NA
33476648,1,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of COVID-19, so understanding its biology and infection mechanisms is critical to facing this major medical challenge. SARS-CoV-2 is known to use its spike glycoprotein to interact with the cell surface as a first step in the infection process. As for other coronaviruses, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 next undergoes endocytosis, but whether or not this is required for infectivity and the precise endocytic mechanism used are unknown. Using purified spike glycoprotein and lentivirus pseudotyped with spike glycoprotein, a common model of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, we now demonstrate that after engagement with the plasma membrane, SARS-CoV-2 undergoes rapid, clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This suggests that transfer of viral RNA to the cell cytosol occurs from the lumen of the endosomal system. Importantly, we further demonstrate that knockdown of clathrin heavy chain, which blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis, reduces viral infectivity. These discoveries reveal that SARS-CoV-2 uses clathrin-mediated endocytosis to gain access into cells and suggests that this process is a key aspect of virus infectivity.",NA,NA,NA

33485945,1,"Antagonising the serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor is an efficacious way to alleviate dyskinesia and psychosis in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, previous research indicates that there might be a limit to the effects conferred by this approach. 5-HT2A receptors were shown to form hetero-dimers with metabotropic glutamate 2 (mGlu2) receptors, in which 5-HT2A blockade and mGlu2 activation elicit equivalent effects at the downstream signalling level. We have previously shown that mGlu2 activation reduces both dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs) induced by L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA), in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned primate. Here, we hypothesised that concurrent 5-HT2A antagonism and mGlu2 activation would provide greater anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic benefits than either approach alone. We conducted 3 series of experiments in the MPTP-lesioned marmoset. In the first series of experiments, the mGlu2 positive allosteric modulator LY-487,379 and the 5-HT2A antagonist EMD-281,014, either alone or in combination, were added to l-DOPA. In the second series of experiments, the mGlu2/3 orthosteric agonist LY-354,740 and EMD-281,014, either alone or in combination, were added to l-DOPA. In the last series of experiments, we investigated whether mGlu2 blockade would diminish the effects of antagonising 5-HT2A receptors. To this end, the mGlu2/3 orthosteric antagonist LY-341,495 and EMD-281,014, either alone or in combination, were added to l-DOPA. We found that the anti-dyskinetic effect of the combination LY-487,379/EMD-281,014 was greater than the ones conferred by LY-487,379 (by 35%, P < 0.05) and EMD-281,014 (by 38%, P < 0.01). The anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic effects of the combination LY-354,740/EMD-281,014 were also greater than the ones conferred by LY-354,740 (by 57% for dyskinesia and 54% for PLBs, both P < 0.001) and EMD-281,014 (by 61% for dyskinesia and 53% for PLBs, both P < 0.001). The anti-parkinsonian action of l-DOPA was maintained with all treatments. Lastly, the addition of LY-341,495 abolished the therapeutic effects of EMD-281,014 on dyskinesia and PLBs. Our results suggest that mGlu2 activation may enhance the anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic effects of 5-HT2A blockade and could provide relief to PD patients with dyskinesia and psychotic symptoms beyond what can be achieved with current therapies.",NA,NA,NA
33500525,1,"Stability is a physical attribute that stands opposite the change. However, it is still unclear how the arrangement of links called topology affects network stability. In this study, we tackled this issue in the resting-state brain network using structural balance. Structural balance theory employs the quality of triadic associations between signed links to determine the network stability. In this study, we showed that negative links of the resting-state network make hubs to reduce balance-energy and push the network into a more stable state compared to null-networks with trivial topologies. In this regard, we created a global measure entitled 'tendency to make hub' to assess the hubness of the network. Besides, we revealed nodal degrees of negative links have an exponential distribution that confirms the existence of negative hubs. Our findings indicate that the arrangement of negative links plays an important role in the balance (stability) of the resting-state brain network.",NA,NA,NA

Major brain initiatives launched around the world are poised to generate huge stores of neuroscience data. At the same time, neuroscience, like many domains in biomedicine, is confronting the issues of transparency, rigor, and reproducibility. Widely used, validated standards and best practices are key to addressing the challenges in both big and small data science, as they are essential for integrating diverse data and for developing a robust, effective, and sustainable infrastructure to support open and reproducible neuroscience. However, developing community standards and gaining their adoption is difficult. The current landscape is characterized both by a lack of robust, validated standards and a plethora of overlapping, underdeveloped, untested and underutilized standards and best practices. The International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF), an independent organization dedicated to promoting data sharing through the coordination of infrastructure and standards, has recently implemented a formal procedure for evaluating and endorsing community standards and best practices in support of the FAIR principles. By formally serving as a standards organization dedicated to open and FAIR neuroscience, INCF helps evaluate, promulgate, and coordinate standards and best practices across neuroscience.

Here, a mega-analysis was performed using a collection of 22 structural brain MRI datasets from the ENIGMA Addiction Working Group. Structural asymmetries of cortical and subcortical regions were compared between individuals who were dependent on alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, methamphetamine, or cannabis (n = 1,796) and nondependent participants (n = 996). Substance-general and substance-specific effects on structural asymmetry were examined using separate models. We found that substance dependence was significantly associated with differences in volume asymmetry of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc; less rightward; Cohen's d = 0.15). This effect was driven by differences from controls in individuals with alcohol dependence (less rightward; Cohen's d = 0.10) and nicotine dependence (less rightward; Cohen's d = 0.11).

33529088,1,"Jules Baillarger was one of the foremost figures of nineteenth-century neurobiology. He is remembered today for his discovery that the human cerebral cortex is composed of six intercalated layers. Even today, two horizontal fiber bundles within cortical layers IV and V are referred to as the outer and inner bands of Baillarger. It is a measure of the importance of Baillarger's discovery that his findings were elaborated upon with advances in microscopy and the development of methods for staining neurons and myelin by, notably, Theodor Meynert and Santiago Ramon y Cajal. Furthermore, Baillarger's observation that there are variations in the thickness of one or another of the six cortical layers in different cortical regions, and the discovery of giant pyramidal motor neurons in layer V of the precentral gyrus, ultimately led to the cytoarchitectonic and myeloarchitectonic maps of Oscar Vogt and Cécile Vogt-Mugnier, and of their student Korbinian Brodmann (1908). Less well known are Baillarger's contributions to the semiology of aphasia and the pivotal role he played in the recognition of the localization and lateralization of speech to the left hemisphere. Paul Broca's localization of articulate language to the posterior aspect of the frontal lobes and Marc Dax's discovery that speech is a function of the left hemisphere were vigorously challenged within French academic medicine until 1865, when Baillarger gave two addresses to the Royal Academy of Medicine. In the first address, he described a form of aphasia he called the perversion of language, which we now call fluent aphasia, and reported that aphasic patients can express words or parts of sentences when they are angry or excited, a phenomenon now known as the Baillarger-Jackson principle. In his second address, Baillarger supported the lateralization of speech to the left hemisphere of the brain and referred to this association as Dax's ""singular law,"" and supported the localization of speech to the posterior aspect of the left inferior frontal gyrus. Baillarger's description of the perversion of language and of the influence of emotions on speech presaged the discipline of aphasiology, and his support for the lateralization of speech to the left hemisphere marks the first instance of the unequivocal recognition of asymmetrical hemispheric functions by academic medicine. This article reviews these aspects of Baillargher's career.

33532543,1,"Since 1989, four Canadian Consensus Conferences on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dementia (CCCDTDs) have provided evidence-based dementia diagnostic and treatment guidelines for Canadian clinicians and researchers. We present the results from the Neuroimaging and Fluid Biomarkers Group of the 5th CCCDTD (CCCDTD5), which addressed topics chosen by the steering committee to reflect advances in the field and build on our previous guidelines. Recommendations on Imaging and Fluid Biomarker Use from this Conference cover a series of different fields. Prior structural imaging recommendations for both computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remain largely unchanged, but MRI is now more central to the evaluation than before, with suggested sequences described here. The use of visual rating scales for both atrophy and white matter anomalies is now included in our recommendations. Molecular imaging with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]-FDG) Positron Emisson Tomography (PET) or [99mTc]-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime/ethylene cysteinate dimer ([99mTc]-HMPAO/ECD) Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPECT), should now decidedly favor PET. The value of [18F]-FDG PET in the assessment of neurodegenerative conditions has been established with greater certainty since the previous conference, and it has now been recognized as a useful biomarker to establish the presence of neurodegeneration by a number of professional organizations around the world. Furthermore, the role of amyloid PET has been clarified and our recommendations follow those from other groups in multiple countries. SPECT with [123I]-ioflupane (DaTscanTM) is now included as a useful study in differentiating Alzheimer's disease (AD) from Lewy body disease. Finally, liquid biomarkers are in a rapid phase of development and, could lead to a revolution in the assessment AD and other neurodegenerative conditions at a reasonable cost.

33536196,1,"Musical training is associated with increased structural and functional connectivity between auditory sensory areas and higher-order brain networks involved in speech and motor processing. Whether such changed connectivity patterns facilitate the cortical propagation of speech information in musicians remains poorly understood. We here used magnetoencephalography (MEG) source imaging and a novel seed-based intersubject phase-locking approach to investigate the effects of musical training on the interregional synchronization of stimulus-driven neural responses during listening to naturalistic continuous speech presented in silence. MEG data were obtained from 20 young human subjects (both sexes) with different degrees of musical training. Our data show robust bilateral patterns of stimulus-driven interregional phase synchronization between auditory cortex and frontotemporal brain regions previously associated with speech processing. Stimulus-driven phase locking was maximal in the delta band, but was also observed in the theta and alpha bands. The individual duration of musical training was positively associated with the magnitude of stimulus-driven alpha-band phase locking between auditory cortex and parts of the dorsal and ventral auditory processing streams. These findings provide evidence for a positive relationship between musical training and the propagation of speech-related information between auditory sensory areas and higher-order processing networks, even when speech is presented in silence. We suggest that the increased synchronization of higher-order cortical regions to auditory cortex may contribute to the previously described musician advantage in processing speech in background noise.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Musical training has been associated with widespread structural and functional brain plasticity. It has been suggested that these changes benefit the production and perception of music but can also translate to other domains of auditory processing, such as speech. We developed a new magnetoencephalography intersubject analysis approach to study the cortical synchronization of stimulus-driven neural responses during the perception of continuous natural speech and its relationship to individual musical training.

33543427,1,"Controlled donation after circulatory determination of death (DCD), where death is determined after cardiac arrest, has been responsible for the largest quantitative increase in Canadian organ donation and transplants, but not for heart transplants. Innovative international advances in DCD heart transplantation include direct procurement and perfusion (DPP) and normothermic regional perfusion (NRP). After death is determined, DPP involves removal and reanimation of the arrested heart on an ex situ organ perfusion system. Normothermic regional perfusion involves surgically interrupting (ligating the aortic arch vessels) brain blood flow after death determination, followed by restarting the heart and circulation in situ using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The objectives of this Canadian consensus building process by a multidisciplinary group of Canadian stakeholders were to review current evidence and international DCD heart experience, comparatively evaluate international protocols with existing Canadian medical, legal, and ethical practices, and to discuss implementation barriers. Review of current evidence and international experience of DCD heart donation (DPP and NRP) determined that DCD heart donation could be used to provide opportunities for more heart transplants in Canada, saving additional lives. Although candid discussion identified a number of potential barriers and challenges for implementing DCD heart donation in Canada, it was determined that DPP implementation is feasible (pending regulatory approval for the use of an ex situ perfusion device in humans) and in alignment with current medical guidelines for DCD.

33544915,1,Observational studies assessing direct oral anticoagulant (DOACs) dosage in atrial fibrillation (AF) reported that a lower proportion of patients received high-dose DOACs compared to those in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Effectiveness and safety of high-dose DOACs relative to apixaban in a real-world AF population need to be addressed. The aim is to assess comparative effectiveness and safety of high-dose rivaroxaban relative to apixaban.,STUDY OBJECTIVE,NA,NA
33544915,2,"We conducted a cohort study. Setting We built a cohort of patients hospitalized and discharged in community with a primary or secondary AF diagnosis from 2011-2017 using Quebec administrative databases (Med-Echo and RAMQ). Patients Cohort entry was defined as the first OAC claim in new users of high-dose rivaroxaban and apixaban, with no OAC claims in the prior year. Intervention To compare effectiveness and safety of high-dose rivaroxaban to apixaban. Measurement We ascertained patient demographics, comorbidities, CHA2DS2-VASc and HASBLED scores and Charlson score within 3 years prior to cohort entry. Primary effectiveness and safety were a composite of ischemic stroke/systemic thrombosis, death, myocardial infarction, and of intracranial bleeding (ICH), extracranial major bleeding, in the first year following drug initiation. We conducted propensity score matching and estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for outcomes using Cox proportional hazard models. All the analyses were conducted to account for competing risks. Main results The cohort consisted of 4,632 and 6,771 patients received high-dose rivaroxaban and apixaban, respectively. High-dose rivaroxaban users were younger with a mean age of 73.2 years, presented less associated comorbidities and had lower CHA2DS2-VASc scores compared to apixaban. High-dose rivaroxaban at the intention to treat was associated with a higher risk of stroke/SE/death (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.04-1.40) and worse composite effectiveness (HR 1.21: 1.05-1.40); under treatment exposure, those values were at HR (1.66: 1.21-2.29) and HR (1.58:1.19-2.10), respectively. And, rivaroxaban presented a less favorable safety profile relative to apixaban. Conclusion In this study, composite effectiveness and safety varied between rivaroxaban and apixaban. High-dose apixaban was observed to have a better effectiveness and safety.",DESIGN,NA,NA

33578194,1,"First-degree family history is an established risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the association of late-onset AD risk loci with cognitive functioning among 315 offspring of AD patients. Participants were cognitively normal Jewish individuals, aged 40-65 years, from the Israel Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (IRAP) study. Twenty-two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within these loci and the APOE E4 allele were included in the final analyses, and a polygenic risk score was also calculated. Using linear regression (assuming an additive genetic model), we found a significant association only for SNP rs9473117, located near the CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) gene, with global cognition. Controlling for demographic variables (age, sex, years of education, and ancestry), the late-onset AD risk allele C was associated with lower global cognitive functioning (p = 0.0005), and withstood correction for multiple testing. After adjusting for additional characteristics (APOE E4 status and then also for cardiovascular factors), the results remained essentially unchanged (p = 0.0003 and p = 0.0005, respectively). In secondary analyses examining specific cognitive domains, rs9473117 was similarly associated with episodic memory (p = 0.005), language (p = 0.009), and working memory/attention (p = 0.018) but not with executive functions (p = 0.27). Again, the results were similar after adjusting for APOE E4 status and cardiovascular factors. The polygenic risk score was not associated with global cognitive functioning or with any of the 4 domains. In conclusion, our findings suggest a contribution of the CD2AP locus to cognitive functioning in middle-aged individuals with a parental history of AD. Further validations, including in longitudinal studies, are required.",NA,NA,NA

Among them, 46(1.8%) MS patients died(the global death-to-case ratio of Covid-19 was reported about 2.1%). Among DMTs, Rituximab had the highest mortality rate (4%). Despite controversies, especially concerning anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapies, a relation between DMT-use and COVID-19 disease- course was not found in many studies. This observation reinforces the recommendation of not stopping current DMTs. Other variables such as age, higher expanded disability status scale (EDSS) scores, cardiac comorbidities, and obesity were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19. Despite the risks of infection, most patients were willing to continue their DMT during the pandemic because of more significant concern about the risk of relapse or worsening MS symptoms. After the infection, an immune response's attenuation was seen in the patients on Fingolimod and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies.

33578853,1,"Metastasis to the central nervous system occurs in approximately 20% of patients with advanced solid cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma. While central nervous system metastases most commonly form in the brain parenchyma, metastatic cancer cells may also reside in the subarachnoid space surrounding the brain and spinal cord to form tumors called leptomeningeal metastases. Leptomeningeal metastasis involves cancer cells that reach the subarachnoid space and proliferate in the cerebrospinal fluid compartment within the leptomeninges, a sequela associated with a myriad of symptoms and poor prognosis. Cancer cells exposed to cerebrospinal fluid in the leptomeninges must contend with a unique microenvironment from those that establish within the brain or other organs. Leptomeningeal lesions provide a formidable clinical challenge due to their often-diffuse infiltration within the subarachnoid space. The molecular mechanisms that promote the establishment of leptomeningeal metastases have begun to be elucidated, demonstrating that it is a biological entity distinct from parenchymal brain metastases and is associated with specific molecular drivers. In this review, we outline the current state of knowledge pertaining to the diagnosis, treatment, and molecular underpinnings of leptomeningeal metastasis.",NA,NA,NA

33584250,1,"The past decade has brought tremendous progress in diagnostic and therapeutic options for cerebrovascular diseases as exemplified by the advent of thrombectomy in ischemic stroke, benefitting a steeply increasing number of stroke patients and potentially paving the way for a renaissance of neuroprotectants. Progress in basic science has been equally impressive. Based on a deeper understanding of pathomechanisms underlying cerebrovascular diseases, new therapeutic targets have been identified and novel treatment strategies such as pre- and post-conditioning methods were developed. Moreover, translationally relevant aspects are increasingly recognized in basic science studies, which is believed to increase their predictive value and the relevance of obtained findings for clinical application.This review reports key results from some of the most remarkable and encouraging achievements in neurovascular research that have been reported at the 10th International Symposium on Neuroprotection and Neurorepair. Basic science topics discussed herein focus on aspects such as neuroinflammation, extracellular vesicles, and the role of sex and age on stroke recovery. Translational reports highlighted endovascular techniques and targeted delivery methods, neurorehabilitation, advanced functional testing approaches for experimental studies, pre-and post-conditioning approaches as well as novel imaging and treatment strategies. Beyond ischemic stroke, particular emphasis was given on activities in the fields of traumatic brain injury and cerebral hemorrhage in which promising preclinical and clinical results have been reported. Although the number of neutral outcomes in clinical trials is still remarkably high when targeting cerebrovascular diseases, we begin to evidence stepwise but continuous progress towards novel treatment options.

33584345,1,"Preeclampsia is a common hypertensive disorder in pregnant women and whose causes and consequences have focused primarily on cardiovascular outcomes on the mother and offspring, often without taking into consideration the possible effects on the brain. One possible cause of preeclampsia has been attributed to alterations in the renin-angiotensin system, which has also been linked to cognitive decline. In this pilot study, we use a transgenic mouse model that chronically overexpresses human angiotensinogen and renin (R+A+ mice) that displayed characteristics of preeclampsia such as proteinuria during gestation. Offspring of these mothers as well as from control mothers were also examined. We were primarily interested in detecting whether cognitive deficits were present in the mothers and offspring in the long term and used a spatial learning and memory task as well as an object recognition task at three timepoints: 3, 8, and 12 months post-partum or post-natal, while measuring blood pressure and performing urine analysis after each timepoint. While we did not find significant deficits in preeclamptic mothers at the later timepoints, we did observe negative consequences in the pups of R+A+ mice that coincided with hemodynamic alterations whereby pups had higher whisker-evoked oxygenated hemoglobin levels and increased cerebral blood flow responses compared to control pups.

33618345,1,"Objective. Nested into slow oscillations (SOs) and modulated by their up-states, spindles are electrophysiological hallmarks of N2 sleep stage that present a complex hierarchical architecture. However, most studies have only described spindles in basic statistical terms, which were limited to the spindle itself without analyzing the characteristics of the pre-spindle moments in which the SOs are originated. The aim of this study was twofold: (a) to apply spectral and temporal measures to the pre-spindle and spindle periods, as well as analyze the correlation between them, and (b) to evaluate the potential of these spectral and temporal measures in future automatic detection algorithms.Approach. An automatic spindle detection algorithm was applied to the overnight electroencephalographic recordings of 26 subjects. Ten complementary features (five spectral and five temporal parameters) were computed in the pre-spindle and spindle periods after their segmentation. These features were computed independently in each period and in a time-resolved way (sliding window). After the statistical comparison of both periods, a correlation analysis was used to assess their interrelationships. Finally, a receiver operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis along with a bootstrap procedure was conducted to further evaluate the degree of separability between the pre-spindle and spindle periods.Main results. The results show important time-varying changes in spectral and temporal parameters. The features calculated in pre-spindle and spindle periods are strongly and significantly correlated, demonstrating the association between the pre-spindle characteristics and the subsequent spindle. The ROC analysis exposes that the typical feature used in automatic spindle detectors, i.e. the power in the sigma band, is outperformed by other features, such as the spectral entropy in this frequency range.Significance. The novel features applied here demonstrate their utility as predictors of spindles that could be incorporated into novel algorithms of automatic spindle detectors, in which the analysis of the pre-spindle period becomes relevant for improving their performance. From the clinical point of view, these features may serve as novel precision therapeutic targets to enhance spindle production with the aim of improving memory, cognition, and sleep quality in healthy and clinical populations. The results evidence the need for characterizing spindles in terms beyond power and the spindle period itself to more dynamic measures and the pre-spindle period. Physiologically, these findings suggest that spindles are more than simple oscillations, but nonstable oscillatory bursts embedded in the complex pre-spindle dynamics.",NA,NA,NA
33622790,1,"Human cortex is patterned by a complex and interdigitated web of large-scale functional networks. Recent methodological breakthroughs reveal variation in the size, shape, and spatial topography of cortical networks across individuals. While spatial network organization emerges across development, is stable over time, and is predictive of behavior, it is not yet clear to what extent genetic factors underlie interindividual differences in network topography. Here, leveraging a nonlinear multidimensional estimation of heritability, we provide evidence that individual variability in the size and topographic organization of cortical networks are under genetic control. Using twin and family data from the Human Connectome Project (n = 1,023), we find increased variability and reduced heritability in the size of heteromodal association networks (h 2 : M = 0.34, SD = 0.070), relative to unimodal sensory/motor cortex (h 2 : M = 0.40, SD = 0.097). We then demonstrate that the spatial layout of cortical networks is influenced by genetics, using our multidimensional estimation of heritability (h 2 -multi; M = 0.14, SD = 0.015). However, topographic heritability did not differ between heteromodal and unimodal networks. Genetic factors had a regionally variable influence on brain organization, such that the heritability of network topography was greatest in prefrontal, precuneus, and posterior parietal cortex. Taken together, these data are consistent with relaxed genetic control of association cortices relative to primary sensory/motor regions and have implications for understanding population-level variability in brain functioning, guiding both individualized prediction and the interpretation of analyses that integrate genetics and neuroimaging.",NA,NA,NA

Our previous review in 2015, Brain shift in neuronavigation of brain tumours: A review offered a new taxonomy, classification system, and a historical perspective on the causes, measurement, and pre- and intra-operative compensation of this phenomenon. Here we present an updated review using the same taxonomy and framework, focused on the developments of intra-operative ultrasound-based brain shift research from 2015 to the present (2020). The review was performed using PubMed to identify articles since 2015 with the specific words and phrases: ""Brain shift"" AND ""Ultrasound"". Since 2015, the rate of publication of intra-operative ultrasound based articles in the context of brain shift has increased from 2-3 per year to 8-10 per year. This efficient and low-cost technology and increasing comfort among clinicians and researchers have allowed unique avenues of development. Since 2015, there has been a trend towards more mathematical advancements in the field which is often validated on publicly available datasets from early intra-operative ultrasound research, and may not give a just representation to the intra-operative imaging landscape in modern image-guided neurosurgery. Focus on vessel-based registration and virtual and augmented reality paradigms have seen traction, offering new perspectives to overcome some of the different pitfalls of ultrasound based technologies. Unfortunately, clinical adaptation and evaluation has not seen as significant of a publication boost. Brain shift continues to be a highly prevalent pitfall in maintaining accuracy throughout oncologic neurosurgical intervention and continues to be an area of active research. Intra-operative ultrasound continues to show promise as an effective, efficient, and low-cost solution for intra-operative accuracy management. A major drawback of the current research landscape is that mathematical tool validation based on retrospective data outpaces prospective clinical evaluations decreasing the strength of the evidence. The need for newer and more publicly available clinical datasets will be instrumental in more reliable validation of these methods that reflect the modern intra-operative imaging in these procedures.",NA,NA,NA
33631091,1,"Hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis is a progressive disease caused by mutations in the TTR gene leading to multisystem organ dysfunction. Pathogenic TTR aggregation, misfolding, and fibrillization lead to deposition of amyloid in multiple body organs and frequently involve the peripheral nerve system and the heart. Common neurologic manifestations include: sensorimotor polyneuropathy (PN), autonomic neuropathy, small-fiber PN, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Many patients have significant progression due to diagnostic delays as hATTR PN is not considered within the differential diagnosis. Recently, two effective novel disease-modifying therapies, inotersen and patisiran, were approved by Health Canada for the treatment of hATTR PN. Early diagnosis is crucial for the timely introduction of these disease-modifying treatments that reduce impairments, improve quality of life, and extend survival. In this guideline, we aim to improve awareness and outcomes of hATTR PN by making recommendations directed to the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment in Canada.",NA,NA,NA

L’agrégation, le mauvais repliement et la fibrillisation pathogènes de la TTR aboutissent au dépôt de protéines amyloïdes dans plusieurs organes, et affectent souvent le système nerveux périphérique et le cœur. Les troubles neurologiques fréquents comprennent une polyneuropathie sensorimotrice (PN), une neuropathie autonome, une polyneuropathie des petites fibres et le syndrome du canal carpien. Chez bon nombre de patients, la maladie a connu une évolution importante en raison de la pose tardive du diagnostic, la PN-ATTRh ne faisant pas l’objet d’un diagnostic différentiel. Santé Canada a approuvé, depuis peu, deux nouveaux médicaments modificateurs de la PN-ATTRh et efficaces contre l’affection, soit l’inotersen et le patisiran.

33634751,1,"In 2008, we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes (canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker for bona fide autophagic responses. Here, we critically discuss current methods of assessing autophagy and the information they can, or cannot, provide. Our ultimate goal is to encourage intellectual and technical innovation in the field.",NA,NA,NA

33649377,1,"Even though sleep modification is a hallmark of the aging process, age-related changes in functional connectivity using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) during sleep, remain unknown. Here, we combined electroencephalography and fMRI to examine functional connectivity differences between wakefulness and light sleep stages (N1 and N2 stages) in 16 young (23.1 ± 3.3y; 7 women), and 14 older individuals (59.6 ± 5.7y; 8 women). Results revealed extended, distributed (inter-between) and local (intra-within) decreases in network connectivity during sleep both in young and older individuals. However, compared to the young participants, older individuals showed lower decreases in connectivity or even increases in connectivity between thalamus/basal ganglia and several cerebral regions as well as between frontal regions of various networks. These findings reflect a reduced ability of the older brain to disconnect during sleep that may impede optimal disengagement for loss of responsiveness, enhanced lighter and fragmented sleep, and contribute to age effects on sleep-dependent brain plasticity.",NA,NA,NA
33649398,1,"Cognitive impairments are prevalent in Parkinson's disease (PD), but the underlying mechanisms of their development are unknown. In this study, we aimed to predict global cognition (GC) in PD with machine learning (ML) using structural neuroimaging, genetics and clinical and demographic characteristics. As a post-hoc analysis, we aimed to explore the connection between novel selected features and GC more precisely and to investigate whether this relationship is specific to GC or is driven by specific cognitive domains. 101 idiopathic PD patients had a cognitive assessment, structural MRI and blood draw. ML was performed on 102 input features including demographics, cortical thickness and subcortical measures, and several genetic variants (APOE, MAPT, SNCA, etc.). Using the combination of RRELIEFF and Support Vector Regression, 11 features were found to be predictive of GC including sex, rs894280, Edinburgh Handedness Inventory, UPDRS-III, education, five cortical thickness measures (R-parahippocampal, L-entorhinal, R-rostral anterior cingulate, L-middle temporal, and R-transverse temporal), and R-caudate volume. The rs894280 of SNCA gene was selected as the most novel finding of ML. Post-hoc analysis revealed a robust association between rs894280 and GC, attention, and visuospatial abilities. This variant indicates a potential role for the SNCA gene in cognitive impairments of idiopathic PD.",NA,NA,NA
33652144,1,"A body of literature has demonstrated that the right auditory cortex (AC) plays a dominant role in fine pitch processing. However, our understanding is relatively limited about whether this asymmetry extends to perceptual learning of pitch. There is also a lack of causal evidence regarding the role of the right AC in pitch learning.  We addressed these points with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), adapting a previous behavioral study in which anodal tDCS over the right AC was shown to block improvement of a microtonal pitch pattern learning task over 3 days. To address the physiological changes associated with tDCS, we recorded MEG data simultaneously with tDCS on the first day, and measured behavioral thresholds on the following two consecutive days. We tested three groups of participants who received anodal tDCS over their right or left AC, or sham tDCS, and measured the N1m auditory evoked response before, during, and after tDCS. Our data show that anodal tDCS of the right AC disrupted pitch discrimination learning up to two days after its application, whereas learning was unaffected by left-AC or sham tDCS. Although tDCS reduced the amplitude of the N1m ipsilaterally to the stimulated hemisphere on both left and right, only right AC N1m amplitude reductions were associated with the degree to which pitch learning was disrupted. This brain-behavior relationship confirms a causal link between right AC physiological responses and fine pitch processing, and provides neurophysiological insight concerning the mechanisms of action of tDCS on the auditory system.",NA,NA,NA
33659930,1,"Hypomyelinating leukodystrophies are a group of genetic disorders characterized by insufficient myelin deposition during development. A subset of hypomyelinating leukodystrophies, named RNA polymerase III (Pol III or POLR3)-related leukodystrophy or 4H (Hypomyelination, Hypodontia and Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism) leukodystrophy, was found to be caused by biallelic variants in genes encoding subunits of the enzyme Pol III, including POLR3A, POLR3B, POLR3K, and POLR1C. Pol III is one of the three nuclear RNA polymerases that synthesizes small non-coding RNAs, such as tRNAs, 5S RNA, and others, that are involved in the regulation of essential cellular processes, including transcription, translation and RNA maturation. Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS) revealed that a number of mutations causing POLR3-related leukodystrophy impair normal assembly or biogenesis of Pol III, often causing a retention of the unassembled subunits in the cytoplasm. Even though these proteomic studies have helped to understand the molecular defects associated with leukodystrophy, how these mutations cause hypomyelination has yet to be defined. In this review we propose two main hypotheses to explain how mutations affecting Pol III subunits can cause hypomyelination.",NA,NA,NA
33661586,1,"The subicular complex (hereafter referred as subiculum), which is reciprocally connected with the hippocampus and rhinal cortices, exerts a major control on hippocampal outputs. Over the last three decades, several studies have revealed that the subiculum plays a pivotal role in learning and memory but also in pathological conditions such as mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Indeed, subicular networks actively contribute to seizure generation and this structure is relatively spared from the cell loss encountered in this focal epileptic disorder. In this review, we will address: (i) the functional properties of subicular principal cells under normal and pathological conditions; (ii) the subiculum role in sustaining seizures in in vivo models of MTLE and in in vitro models of epileptiform synchronization; (iii) its presumptive role in human MTLE; and (iv) evidence underscoring the relationship between subiculum and antiepileptic drug effects.

33665553,1,"A core goal in cognitive neuroscience is identifying the physical substrates of the patterns of thought that occupy our daily lives. Contemporary views suggest that the landscape of ongoing experience is heterogeneous and can be influenced by features of both the person and the context. This perspective piece considers recent work that explicitly accounts for both the heterogeneity of the experience and context dependence of patterns of ongoing thought. These studies reveal that systems linked to attention and control are important for organizing experience in response to changing environmental demands. These studies also establish a role of the default mode network beyond task-negative or purely episodic content, for example, implicating it in the level of vivid detail in experience in both task contexts and in spontaneous self-generated experiential states. Together, this work demonstrates that the landscape of ongoing thought is reflected in the activity of multiple neural systems, and it is important to distinguish between processes contributing to how the experience unfolds from those linked to how these experiences are regulated.",NA,NA,NA
33667310,1,"Prior research has shown a role of the medial temporal lobe, particularly the hippocampal-parahippocampal complex, in spatial cognition. Here, we developed a new paradigm, the conformational shift spatial task (CSST), which examines the ability to encode and retrieve spatial relations between unrelated items. This task is short, uses symbolic cues, incorporates two difficulty levels, and can be administered inside the scanner. A cohort of 48 healthy young adults underwent the CSST, together with a set of behavioral measures and multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Inter-individual differences in CSST performance correlated with scores on an established spatial memory paradigm, but neither with episodic memory nor mnemonic discrimination, supporting specificity. Analyzing high-resolution structural MRI data, individuals with better spatial memory showed thicker medial and lateral temporal cortices. Functional relevance of these findings was supported by task-based functional MRI analysis in the same participants and ad hoc meta-analysis. Exploratory resting-state functional MRI analyses centered on clusters of morphological effects revealed additional modulation of intrinsic network integration, particularly between lateral and medial temporal structures. Our work presents a novel spatial memory paradigm and supports an integrated structure-function substrate in the human temporal lobe. Task paradigms are programmed in python and made open access.",NA,NA,NA
33677075,1,"The hippocampus has been extensively studied in various neuropsychiatric disorders throughout the lifespan. However, inconsistent results have been reported with respect to which subfield volumes are most related to age. Here, we investigate whether these discrepancies may be explained by experimental design differences that exist between studies. Multiple datasets were used to collect 1690 magnetic resonance scans from healthy individuals aged 18-95 years old. Standard T1-weighted (T1w; MPRAGE sequence, 1 mm3 voxels), high-resolution T2-weighted (T2w; SPACE sequence, 0.64 mm3 voxels) and slab T2-weighted (Slab; 2D turbo spin echo, 0.4 × 0.4 × 2 mm3 voxels) images were included. The MAGeT Brain algorithm was used for segmentation of the hippocampal grey matter (GM) subfields and peri-hippocampal white matter (WM) subregions. Linear mixed-effect models and Akaike information criterion were used to examine linear, second or third order natural splines relationship between hippocampal volumes and age. We demonstrated that stratum radiatum/lacunosum/moleculare and fornix subregions expressed the highest relative volumetric decrease, while the cornus ammonis 1 presented a relative volumetric preservation of its volume with age. We also found that volumes extracted from slab images demonstrated different age-related relationships compared to volumes extracted from T1w and T2w images. The current work suggests that although T1w, T2w and slab derived subfield volumetric outputs are largely homologous, modality choice plays a meaningful role in the volumetric estimation of the hippocampal subfields.",NA,NA,NA

33679324,1,"In contrast to the prenatal topographic development of sensory cortices, striatal circuit organization is slow and requires the functional maturation of cortical and thalamic excitatory inputs throughout the first postnatal month. While mechanisms regulating synapse development and plasticity are quite well described at excitatory synapses of glutamatergic neurons in the neocortex, comparatively little is known of how this translates to glutamate synapses onto GABAergic neurons in the striatum. Here we investigate excitatory striatal synapse plasticity in an in vitro system, where glutamate can be studied in isolation from dopamine and other neuromodulators. We examined pre-and post-synaptic structural and functional plasticity in GABAergic striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs), co-cultured with glutamatergic cortical neurons. After synapse formation, medium-term (24 h) TTX silencing increased the density of filopodia, and modestly decreased dendritic spine density, when assayed at 21 days in vitro (DIV). Spine reductions appeared to require residual spontaneous activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors. Conversely, chronic (14 days) TTX silencing markedly reduced spine density without any observed increase in filopodia density. Time-dependent, biphasic changes to the presynaptic marker Synapsin-1 were also observed, independent of residual spontaneous activity. Acute silencing (3 h) did not affect presynaptic markers or postsynaptic structures. To induce rapid, activity-dependent plasticity in striatal neurons, a chemical NMDA receptor-dependent ""long-term potentiation (LTP)"" paradigm was employed. Within 30 min, this increased spine and GluA1 cluster densities, and the percentage of spines containing GluA1 clusters, without altering the presynaptic signal. The results demonstrate that the growth and pruning of dendritic protrusions is an active process, requiring glutamate receptor activity in striatal projection neurons. Furthermore, NMDA receptor activation is sufficient to drive glutamatergic structural plasticity in SPNs, in the absence of dopamine or other neuromodulators.",NA,NA,NA

Although the practical utility of VPL was once thought to be limited by its specificity to the precise stimuli used during training, more recent work has shown that such specificity can be overcome with appropriate training protocols. In contrast, relatively little is known about the extent to which VPL exhibits motor specificity. Previous studies have yielded mixed results. In this work, we have examined the effector specificity of VPL by training observers on a motion discrimination task that maintains the same visual stimulus (drifting grating) and task structure, but that requires different effectors to indicate the response (saccade vs. button press). We find that, in these conditions, VPL transfers fully between a manual and an oculomotor response.

33713002,1,"Aggregation and deposition of α-synuclein (α-syn) in Lewy bodies within dopamine neurons of substantia nigra (SN) is the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). These toxic α-syn aggregates are believed to propagate from neuron-to-neuron and spread the α-syn pathology throughout the brain beyond dopamine neurons in a prion-like manner. Targeting propagation of such α-syn aggregates is of high interest but requires identifying pathways involving in this process. Evidence from previous Alzheimer's disease reports suggests that EGFR may be involved in the prion-like propagation and seeding of amyloid-β. We show here that EGFR regulates the uptake of exogenous α-syn-PFFs and the levels of endogenous α-syn in cell cultures and a mouse model of α-syn propagation, respectively. Thus, we tested the therapeutic potentials of AZD3759, a highly selective BBB-penetrating EGFR inhibitor, in a preclinical mouse model of α-syn propagation. AZD3759 decreases activated EGFR levels in the brain and reduces phosphorylated α-synuclein (pSyn) pathology in brain sections, including striatum and SN. As AZD3759 is already in the clinic, this paper's results suggest a possible repositioning of AZD3759 as a disease-modifying approach for PD.",NA,NA,NA

Here, we analyzed a total of 400 HSP patients (291 families) from different centers across Canada by whole exome sequencing (WES). Three patients with heterozygous GCH1 variants were identified: monozygotic twins with a p.(Ser77_Leu82del) variant, and a patient with a p.(Val205Glu) variant. The former variant is predicted to be likely pathogenic and the latter is pathogenic. The three patients presented with childhood-onset lower limb spasticity, hyperreflexia and abnormal plantar responses. One of the patients had diurnal fluctuations, and none had parkinsonism or dystonia. Phenotypic differences between the monozygotic twins were observed, who responded well to levodopa treatment. Pathway enrichment analysis suggested that GCH1 shares processes and pathways with other HSP-associated genes, and structural analysis of the variants indicated a disruptive effect. In conclusion, GCH1 mutations may cause HSP; therefore, we suggest a levodopa trial in HSP patients and including GCH1 in the screening panels of HSP genes. Clinical differences between monozygotic twins suggest that environmental factors, epigenetics, and stochasticity could play a role in the clinical presentation.",NA,NA,NA

Using a large multi-site prospective longitudinal dataset of infants with low and high familial risk for ASD, metrics of PAF at 12 months were extracted and growth curves estimated for cognitive development between 12-36 months. Analyses tested whether PAF 1) differs between low and high risk infants, 2) is associated with concurrent non-verbal/verbal cognitive ability and 3) predicts developmental change in non-verbal/verbal ability. Moderation of associations between PAF and cognitive ability by familial risk status was also tested. No differences in 12-month PAF were found between low and high risk infants. PAF was associated with concurrent non-verbal cognitive ability, but did not predict change in non-verbal cognitive over development. No associations were found between PAF and verbal ability, along with no evidence of moderation. PAF is not related to familial risk for ASD, and is a neural marker of concurrent non-verbal cognitive ability, but not verbal ability, in young infants at low and high risk for ASD.",NA,NA,NA
33720339,1,"Vascular anomalies, including local and peripheral thrombosis, are a hallmark of glioblastoma (GBM) and an aftermath of deregulation of the cancer cell genome and epigenome. Although the molecular effectors of these changes are poorly understood, the upregulation of podoplanin (PDPN) by cancer cells has recently been linked to an increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in GBM patients. Therefore, regulation of this platelet-activating protein by transforming events in cancer cells is of considerable interest. We used single-cell and bulk transcriptome data mining, as well as cellular and xenograft models in mice, to analyze the nature of cells expressing PDPN, as well as their impact on the activation of the coagulation system and platelets. We report that PDPN is expressed by distinct (mesenchymal) GBM cell subpopulations and downregulated by oncogenic mutations of EGFR and IDH1 genes, along with changes in chromatin modifications (enhancer of zeste homolog 2) and DNA methylation. Glioma cells exteriorize their PDPN and/or tissue factor (TF) as cargo of exosome-like extracellular vesicles (EVs) shed from cells in vitro and in vivo. Injection of glioma-derived podoplanin carrying extracelluar vesicles (PDPN-EVs) activates platelets, whereas tissue factor carrying extracellular vesicles (TF-EVs) activate the clotting cascade. Similarly, an increase in platelet activation (platelet factor 4) or coagulation (D-dimer) markers occurs in mice harboring the corresponding glioma xenografts expressing PDPN or TF, respectively. Coexpression of PDPN and TF by GBM cells cooperatively affects tumor microthrombosis. Thus, in GBM, distinct cellular subsets drive multiple facets of cancer-associated thrombosis and may represent targets for phenotype- and cell type-based diagnosis and antithrombotic intervention.",NA,NA,NA

33724186,1,"Partial phagocytosis-called trogocytosis-of axons by microglia has been documented in ex vivo preparations but has not been directly observed in vivo. The mechanisms that modulate microglial trogocytosis of axons and its function in neural circuit development remain poorly understood. Here, we directly observe axon trogocytosis by microglia in vivo in the developing Xenopus laevis retinotectal circuit. We show that microglia regulate pruning of retinal ganglion cell axons and are important for proper behavioral response to dark and bright looming stimuli. Using bioinformatics, we identify amphibian regulator of complement activation 3, a homolog of human CD46, as a neuronally expressed synapse-associated complement inhibitory molecule that inhibits trogocytosis and axonal pruning. Using a membrane-bound complement C3 fusion protein, we demonstrate that enhancing complement activity enhances axonal pruning. Our results support the model that microglia remodel axons via trogocytosis and that neurons can control this process through expression of complement inhibitory proteins.",NA,NA,NA
33727581,1,"In functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), deconvolution analysis of oxy and deoxy-hemoglobin concentration changes allows estimating specific hemodynamic response functions (HRF) elicited by neuronal activity, taking advantage of the fNIRS excellent temporal resolution. Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is also becoming the new standard reconstruction procedure as it is more accurate than the modified Beer Lambert law approach at the sensor level. The objective of this study was to assess the relevance of HRF deconvolution after DOT constrained along the cortical surface. We used local personalized fNIRS montages which consists in optimizing the position of fNIRS optodes to ensure maximal sensitivity to subject specific target brain regions. We carefully evaluated the accuracy of deconvolution when applied after DOT, using realistic simulations involving several HRF models at different signal to noise ratio (SNR) levels and on real data related to motor and visual tasks in healthy subjects and from spontaneous pathological activity in one patient with epilepsy. We demonstrated that DOT followed by deconvolution was able to accurately recover a large variability of HRFs over a large range of SNRs. We found good performances of deconvolution analysis for SNR levels usually encountered in our applications and we were able to reconstruct accurately the temporal dynamics of HRFs in real conditions.",NA,NA,NA
33730163,1,"Episodic memory is the ability to remember events from our past accurately. The process of pattern separation is hypothesized to underpin this ability and is defined as the capacity to orthogonalize memory traces, to maximize the features that make them unique. Contemporary cognitive neuroscience suggests that pattern separation entails complex interactions between the hippocampus and neocortex, where specific hippocampal subregions shape neural reinstatement in the neocortex. To test this hypothesis, the current work studied both healthy controls and patients with temporal lobe epilepsy who presented with hippocampal structural anomalies. We measured neural activity in all participants using functional MRI while they retrieved memorized items or lure items, which shared features with the target. Behaviourally, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy were less able to exclude lures than controls and showed a reduction in pattern separation. To assess the hypothesized relationship between neural patterns in the hippocampus and neocortex, we identified the topographic gradients of intrinsic connectivity along neocortical and hippocampal subfield surfaces and determined the topographic profile of the neural activity accompanying pattern separation. In healthy controls, pattern separation followed a graded topography of neural activity, both along the hippocampal long axis (and peaked in anterior segments that are more heavily engaged in transmodal processing) and along the neocortical hierarchy running from unimodal to transmodal regions (peaking in transmodal default mode regions). In patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, however, this concordance between task-based functional activations and topographic gradients was markedly reduced. Furthermore, person-specific measures of concordance between task-related activity and connectivity gradients in patients and controls were related to inter-individual differences in behavioural measures of pattern separation and episodic memory, highlighting the functional relevance of the observed topographic motifs. Our work is consistent with an emerging understanding that successful discrimination between memories with similar features entails a shift in the locus of neural activity away from sensory systems, a pattern that is mirrored along the hippocampal long axis and with respect to neocortical hierarchies. More broadly, our study establishes topographic profiling using intrinsic connectivity gradients, capturing the functional underpinnings of episodic memory processes in a manner that is sensitive to their reorganization in pathology.",NA,NA,NA
33731448,1,"There is much debate about the existence and function of neural oscillatory mechanisms in the auditory system. The frequency-following response (FFR) is an index of neural periodicity encoding that can provide a vehicle to study entrainment in frequency ranges relevant to speech and music processing. Criteria for entrainment include the presence of poststimulus oscillations and phase alignment between stimulus and endogenous activity. To test the hypothesis of entrainment, in experiment 1 we collected FFR data for a repeated syllable using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography in 20 male and female human adults. We observed significant oscillatory activity after stimulus offset in auditory cortex and subcortical auditory nuclei, consistent with entrainment. In these structures, the FFR fundamental frequency converged from a lower value over 100 ms to the stimulus frequency, consistent with phase alignment, and diverged to a lower value after offset, consistent with relaxation to a preferred frequency. In experiment 2, we tested how transitions between stimulus frequencies affected the MEG FFR to a train of tone pairs in 30 people. We found that the FFR was affected by the frequency of the preceding tone for up to 40 ms at subcortical levels, and even longer durations at cortical levels. Our results suggest that oscillatory entrainment may be an integral part of periodic sound representation throughout the auditory neuraxis. The functional role of this mechanism is unknown, but it could serve as a fine-scale temporal predictor for frequency information, enhancing stability and reducing susceptibility to degradation that could be useful in real-life noisy environments.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Neural oscillations are proposed to be a ubiquitous aspect of neural function, but their contribution to auditory encoding is not clear, particularly at higher frequencies associated with pitch encoding. In a magnetoencephalography experiment, we found converging evidence that the frequency-following response has an oscillatory component according to established criteria: poststimulus resonance, progressive entrainment of the neural frequency to the stimulus frequency, and relaxation toward the original state on stimulus offset. In a second experiment, we found that the frequency and amplitude of the frequency-following response to tones are affected by preceding stimuli. These findings support the contribution of intrinsic oscillations to the encoding of sound, and raise new questions about their functional roles, possibly including stabilization and low-level predictive coding.",NA,NA,NA

33744096,1,"Mutations in the HADHB gene lead to Mitochondrial Trifunctional Protein (MTP) deficiency. MTP deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder affecting long-chain fatty acid oxidation. Patients affected by MTP deficiency are unable to metabolize long-chain fatty-acids and suffer a variety of symptoms exacerbated during fasting. The three phenotypes associated with complete MTP deficiency are an early-onset cardiomyopathy and early death, an intermediate form with recurrent hypoketotic hypoglycemia and a sensorimotor neuropathy with episodic rhabdomyolysis with small amount of residual enzyme activities. This review aims to discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical manifestations of each phenotype, which appears different and linked to HADHB expression levels. Notably, the pathophysiology of the sensorimotor neuropathy is relatively unknown and we provide a hypothesis on the qualitative aspect of the role of acylcarnitine buildup in Schwann cells in MTP deficiency patients. We propose that acylcarnitine may exit the Schwann cell and alter membrane properties of nearby axons leading to axonal degeneration based on recent findings in different metabolic disorders.",NA,NA,NA
33746727,1,"Successful surgical treatment of patients with focal drug-resistant epilepsy remains challenging, especially in cases for which it is difficult to define the area of cortex from which seizures originate, the seizure onset zone (SOZ). Various diagnostic methods are needed to select surgical candidates and determine the extent of resection. Interictal magnetoencephalography (MEG) with source imaging has proven to be useful for presurgical evaluation, but the use of ictal MEG data remains limited. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether pre-ictal variations of spectral properties of neural activity from ictal MEG recordings are predictive of SOZ location.We performed a 4 h overnight MEG recording in an 8-year-old child with drug-resistant focal epilepsy of suspected right fronto-temporal origin and captured one ~45-s seizure. The patient underwent a right temporal resection from the anterior temporal neocortex and amygdala to the mid-posterior temporal neocortex, sparing the hippocampus proper. She remains seizure-free 21 months postoperatively. The histopathological assessment confirmed frank focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type IIa in the MEG-defined SOZ, which was based on source imaging of averaged ictal spikes at seizure onset. We investigated temporal changes (inter-ictal, pre-ictal, and ictal periods) together with spatial differences (SOZ vs. control regions) in spectral parameters of background brain activity, namely the aperiodic broadband offset and slope, and assessed how they confounded the interpretation of apparent variations of signal power in typical electrophysiological bands. Our data show that the SOZ was associated with a higher aperiodic offset and exponent during the seizure compared to control regions. Both parameters increased in all regions from 2 min before the seizure onwards. Regions anatomically closer to the SOZ also expressed higher values compared to contralateral regions, potentially indicating ictal spread. We also show that narrow-band power changes were caused by these fluctuations in the aperiodic component of ongoing brain activity. Our results indicate that the broadband aperiodic component of ongoing brain activity cannot be reduced to background noise of no physiological interest, and rather may be indicative of the neuropathophysiology of the SOZ. We believe these findings will inspire future studies of ictal MEG cases and confirm their significance.",NA,NA,NA

33749723,1,"Mutations in CHCHD10, coding for a mitochondrial intermembrane space protein, are a rare cause of autosomal dominant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Mutation-specific toxic gain of function or haploinsufficiency models have been proposed to explain pathogenicity. To decipher the metabolic dysfunction associated with the haploinsufficient p.R15L variant, we integrated transcriptomic, metabolomic and proteomic data sets in patient cells subjected to an energetic stress that forces the cells to rely on oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production. Patient cells had a complex I deficiency that resulted in an increased NADH/NAD+ ratio, diminished TCA cycle activity, a reorganization of one carbon metabolism and an increased AMP/ATP ratio leading to phosphorylation of AMPK and inhibition of mTORC1. These metabolic changes activated the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the ER through the IRE1/XBP1 pathway, upregulating downstream targets including ATF3, ATF4, CHOP and EGLN3, and two cytokine markers of mitochondrial disease, GDF15 and FGF21. Activation of the mitochondrial UPR was mediated through an upregulation of the transcription factors ATF4 and ATF5, leading to increased expression of mitochondrial proteases and heat shock proteins. There was a striking transcriptional up regulation of at least seven dual specific phosphatases, associated with an almost complete dephosphorylation of JNK isoforms, suggesting a concerted deactivation of MAP kinase pathways. This study demonstrates that loss of CHCHD10 function elicits an energy deficit that activates unique responses to nutrient stress in both the mitochondria and ER, which may contribute to the selective vulnerability of motor neurons.",NA,NA,NA
33749742,1,"Humans can mentally represent auditory information without an external stimulus, but the specificity of these internal representations remains unclear. Here, we asked how similar the temporally unfolding neural representations of imagined music are compared to those during the original perceived experience. We also tested whether rhythmic motion can influence the neural representation of music during imagery as during perception. Participants first memorized six 1-min-long instrumental musical pieces with high accuracy. Functional MRI data were collected during: 1) silent imagery of melodies to the beat of a visual metronome; 2) same but while tapping to the beat; and 3) passive listening. During imagery, inter-subject correlation analysis showed that melody-specific temporal response patterns were reinstated in right associative auditory cortices. When tapping accompanied imagery, the melody-specific neural patterns were reinstated in more extensive temporal-lobe regions bilaterally. These results indicate that the specific contents of conscious experience are encoded similarly during imagery and perception in the dynamic activity of auditory cortices. Furthermore, rhythmic motion can enhance the reinstatement of neural patterns associated with the experience of complex sounds, in keeping with models of motor to sensory influences in auditory processing.",NA,NA,NA

33757905,1,"The brain hemispheres can be divided into an upper dorsal and a lower ventral system. Each system consists of distinct cortical regions connected via long association tracts. The tracts cross the central sulcus or the limen insulae to connect the frontal lobe with the posterior brain. The dorsal stream is associated with sensorimotor mapping. The ventral stream serves structural analysis and semantics in different domains, as visual, acoustic or space processing. How does the prefrontal cortex, regarded as the platform for the highest level of integration, incorporate information from these different domains? In the current view, the ventral pathway consists of several separate tracts, related to different modalities. Originally the assumption was that the ventral path is a continuum, covering all modalities. The latter would imply a very different anatomical basis for cognitive and clinical models of processing. To further define the ventral connections, we used cutting-edge in vivo global tractography on high-resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data from 100 normal subjects from the human connectome project and ex vivo preparation of fiber bundles in the extreme capsule of 8 humans using the Klingler technique. Our data showed that ventral stream tracts, traversing through the extreme capsule, form a continuous band of fibers that fan out anteriorly to the prefrontal cortex, and posteriorly to temporal, occipital and parietal cortical regions. Introduction of additional volumes of interest in temporal and occipital lobes differentiated between the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle (IFOF) and uncinate fascicle (UF). Unequivocally, in both experiments, in all subjects a connection between the inferior frontal and middle-to-posterior temporal cortical region, otherwise known as the temporo-frontal extreme capsule fascicle (ECF) from nonhuman primate brain-tracing experiments was identified. In the human brain, this tract connects the language domains of ""Broca's area"" and ""Wernicke's area"". The differentiation in the three tracts, IFOF, UF and ECF seems arbitrary, all three pass through the extreme capsule. Our data show that the ventral pathway represents a continuum. The three tracts merge seamlessly and streamlines showed considerable overlap in their anterior and posterior course. Terminal maps identified prefrontal cortex in the frontal lobe and association cortex in temporal, occipital and parietal lobes as streamline endings. This anatomical substrate potentially facilitates the prefrontal cortex to integrate information across different domains and modalities.",NA,NA,NA
33761369,1,"Actin is a key structural protein that makes up the cytoskeleton of cells, and plays a role in functions such as division, migration, and vesicle trafficking. It comprises six different cell-type specific isoforms: ACTA1, ACTA2, ACTB, ACTC1, ACTG1, and ACTG2. Abnormal actin isoform expression has been reported in many cancers, which led us to hypothesize that it may serve as an early biomarker of cancer. We show an overview of the different actin isoforms and highlight mechanisms by which they may contribute to tumorigenicity. Furthermore, we suggest how the aberrant expression of actin subunits can confer cells with greater proliferation ability, increased migratory capability, and chemoresistance through incorporation into the normal cellular F-actin network and altered actin binding protein interaction.

33766753,1,"In the last few years, a significant amount of work has aimed to characterize maturational trajectories of cortical development. The role of pericortical microstructure putatively characterized as the gray-white matter contrast (GWC) at the pericortical gray-white matter boundary and its relationship to more traditional morphological measures of cortical morphometry has emerged as a means to examine finer grained neuroanatomical underpinnings of cortical changes. In this work, we characterize the GWC developmental trajectories in a representative sample (n = 394) of children and adolescents (~4 to ~22 years of age), with repeated scans (1-3 scans per subject, total scans n = 819). We tested whether linear, quadratic, or cubic trajectories of contrast development best described changes in GWC. A best-fit model was identified vertex-wise across the whole cortex via the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). GWC across nearly the whole brain was found to significantly change with age. Cubic trajectories were likeliest for 63% of vertices, quadratic trajectories were likeliest for 20% of vertices, and linear trajectories were likeliest for 16% of vertices. A main effect of sex was observed in some regions, where males had a higher GWC than females. However, no sex by age interactions were found on GWC. In summary, our results suggest a progressive decrease in GWC at the pericortical boundary throughout childhood and adolescence. This work contributes to efforts seeking to characterize typical, healthy brain development and, by extension, can help elucidate aberrant developmental trajectories.",NA,NA,NA

33782048,1,"Music's ability to induce feelings of pleasure has been the subject of intense neuroscientific research lately. Prior neuroimaging studies have shown that music-induced pleasure engages cortico-striatal circuits related to the anticipation and receipt of biologically relevant rewards/incentives, but these reports are necessarily correlational. Here, we studied both the causal role of this circuitry and its temporal dynamics by applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the left dorsolateral PFC combined with fMRI in 17 male and female participants. Behaviorally, we found that, in accord with previous findings, excitation of fronto-striatal pathways enhanced subjective reports of music-induced pleasure and motivation, whereas inhibition of the same circuitry led to the reduction of both. fMRI activity patterns indicated that these behavioral changes were driven by bidirectional TMS-induced alteration of fronto-striatal function. Specifically, changes in activity in the NAcc predicted modulation of both hedonic and motivational responses, with a dissociation between pre-experiential versus experiential components of musical reward. In addition, TMS-induced changes in the fMRI functional connectivity between the NAcc and frontal and auditory cortices predicted the degree of modulation of hedonic responses. These results indicate that the engagement of cortico-striatal pathways and the NAcc, in particular, is indispensable to experience rewarding feelings from music.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Neuroimaging studies have shown that music-induced pleasure engages cortico-striatal circuits involved in the processing of biologically relevant rewards. Yet, these reports are necessarily correlational. Here, we studied both the causal role of this circuitry and its temporal dynamics by combining brain stimulation over the frontal cortex with functional imaging. Behaviorally, we found that excitation and inhibition of fronto-striatal pathways enhanced and disrupted, respectively, subjective reports of music-induced pleasure and motivation. These changes were associated with changes in NAcc activity and NAcc coupling with frontal and auditory cortices, dissociating between pre-experimental versus experiential components of musical reward.

33785730,1,"Early difficulties in engaging attentive brain states in social settings could affect learning and have cascading effects on social development. We investigated this possibility using multichannel electroencephalography during a face/non-face paradigm in 8-month-old infants with (FH, n = 91) and without (noFH, n = 40) a family history of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). An event-related potential component reflecting attention engagement, the Nc, was compared between FH infants who received a diagnosis of ASD at 3 years of age (FH-ASD; n = 19), FH infants who did not (FH-noASD; n = 72) and noFH infants (who also did not, hereafter noFH-noASD; n = 40). 'Prototypical' microstates during social attention were extracted from the noFH-noASD group and examined in relation to later categorical and dimensional outcome. Machine-learning was used to identify the microstate features that best predicted ASD and social adaptive skills at three years. Results suggested that whilst measures of brain state timing were related to categorical ASD outcome, brain state strength was related to dimensional measures of social functioning. Specifically, the FH-ASD group showed shorter Nc latency relative to other groups, and duration of the attentive microstate responses to faces was informative for categorical outcome prediction. Reduced Nc amplitude difference between faces with direct gaze and a non-social control stimulus and strength of the attentive microstate to faces contributed to the prediction of dimensional variation in social skills. Taken together, this provides consistent evidence that atypical attention engagement precedes the emergence of difficulties in socialization and indicates that using the spatio-temporal characteristics of whole-brain activation to define brain states in infancy provides an important new approach to understanding of the neurodevelopmental mechanisms that lead to ASD.",NA,NA,NA
33787489,1,"Adolescence is a critical time for the continued maturation of brain networks. Here, we assessed structural connectome development in a large longitudinal sample ranging from childhood to young adulthood. By projecting high-dimensional connectomes into compact manifold spaces, we identified a marked expansion of structural connectomes, with strongest effects in transmodal regions during adolescence. Findings reflected increased within-module connectivity together with increased segregation, indicating increasing differentiation of higher-order association networks from the rest of the brain. Projection of subcortico-cortical connectivity patterns into these manifolds showed parallel alterations in pathways centered on the caudate and thalamus. Connectome findings were contextualized via spatial transcriptome association analysis, highlighting genes enriched in cortex, thalamus, and striatum. Statistical learning of cortical and subcortical manifold features at baseline and their maturational change predicted measures of intelligence at follow-up. Our findings demonstrate that connectome manifold learning can bridge the conceptual and empirical gaps between macroscale network reconfigurations, microscale processes, and cognitive outcomes in adolescent development.",NA,NA,NA
33789137,1,"Brain extraction (a.k.a. skull stripping) is a fundamental step in the neuroimaging pipeline as it can affect the accuracy of downstream preprocess such as image registration, tissue classification, etc. Most brain extraction tools have been designed for and applied to human data and are often challenged by non-human primates (NHP) data. Amongst recent attempts to improve performance on NHP data, deep learning models appear to outperform the traditional tools. However, given the minimal sample size of most NHP studies and notable variations in data quality, the deep learning models are very rarely applied to multi-site samples in NHP imaging. To overcome this challenge, we used a transfer-learning framework that leverages a large human imaging dataset to pretrain a convolutional neural network (i.e. U-Net Model), and then transferred this to NHP data using a small NHP training sample. The resulting transfer-learning model converged faster and achieved more accurate performance than a similar U-Net Model trained exclusively on NHP samples. We improved the generalizability of the model by upgrading the transfer-learned model using additional training datasets from multiple research sites in the Primate Data-Exchange (PRIME-DE) consortium. Our final model outperformed brain extraction routines from popular MRI packages (AFNI, FSL, and FreeSurfer) across a heterogeneous sample from multiple sites in the PRIME-DE with less computational cost (20 s~10 min). We also demonstrated the transfer-learning process enables the macaque model to be updated for use with scans from chimpanzees, marmosets, and other mammals (e.g. pig). Our model, code, and the skull-stripped mask repository of 136 macaque monkeys are publicly available for unrestricted use by the neuroimaging community at https://github.com/HumanBrainED/NHP-BrainExtraction.",NA,NA,NA
33798445,1,"Progressive myoclonus epilepsies (PMEs) comprise a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous rare diseases. Over 70% of PME cases can now be molecularly solved. Known PME genes encode a variety of proteins, many involved in lysosomal and endosomal function. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 84 (78 unrelated) unsolved PME-affected individuals, with or without additional family members, to discover novel causes. We identified likely disease-causing variants in 24 out of 78 (31%) unrelated individuals, despite previous genetic analyses. The diagnostic yield was significantly higher for individuals studied as trios or families (14/28) versus singletons (10/50) (OR = 3.9, p value = 0.01, Fisher's exact test). The 24 likely solved cases of PME involved 18 genes. First, we found and functionally validated five heterozygous variants in NUS1 and DHDDS and a homozygous variant in ALG10, with no previous disease associations. All three genes are involved in dolichol-dependent protein glycosylation, a pathway not previously implicated in PME. Second, we independently validate SEMA6B as a dominant PME gene in two unrelated individuals. Third, in five families, we identified variants in established PME genes; three with intronic or copy-number changes (CLN6, GBA, NEU1) and two very rare causes (ASAH1, CERS1). Fourth, we found a group of genes usually associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, but here, remarkably, presenting as PME, with or without prior developmental delay. Our systematic analysis of these cases suggests that the small residuum of unsolved cases will most likely be a collection of very rare, genetically heterogeneous etiologies.",NA,NA,NA
33804986,1,"Event-related potentials (ERPs) activated by faces and gaze processing are found in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the early stages of their development and may serve as a putative biomarker to supplement behavioral diagnosis. We present a novel approach to the classification of visual ERPs collected from 6-month-old infants using intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) derived from empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Selected features were used as inputs to two machine learning methods (support vector machines and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN)) using nested cross validation. Different runs were executed for the modelling and classification of the participants in the control and high-risk (HR) groups and the classification of diagnosis outcome within the high-risk group: HR-ASD and HR-noASD. The highest accuracy in the classification of familial risk was 88.44%, achieved using a support vector machine (SVM). A maximum accuracy of 74.00% for classifying infants at risk who go on to develop ASD vs. those who do not was achieved through k-NN. IMF-based extracted features were highly effective in classifying infants by risk status, but less effective by diagnostic outcome. Advanced signal analysis of ERPs integrated with machine learning may be considered a first step toward the development of an early biomarker for ASD.",NA,NA,NA
33815047,1,"Nightmares are highly dysphoric dreams that are well-remembered upon awakening. Frequent nightmares have been associated with psychopathology and emotional dysregulation, yet their neural mechanisms remain largely unknown. Our neurocognitive model posits that nightmares reflect dysfunction in a limbic-prefrontal circuit comprising medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, hippocampus, and amygdala. However, there is a paucity of studies that used brain imaging to directly test the neural correlates of nightmares. One such study compared the regional homogeneity (ReHo) of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging blood-oxygen level-dependent signals between frequent nightmare recallers and controls. The main results were greater regional homogeneity in the left anterior cingulate cortex and right inferior parietal lobule for the nightmare recallers than for the controls. In the present study, we aimed to document the ReHo correlates of frequent nightmares using several nightmare severity measures. We acquired resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 18 frequent nightmare recallers aged 18-35 (3 males and 15 females) and 18 age- and sex-matched controls, as well as retrospective and prospective disturbed dreaming frequency estimates and scores on the Nightmare Distress Questionnaire. While there were inconsistent results for our different analyses (group comparisons, correlational analyses for frequency estimates/Nightmare Distress scores), our results suggest that nightmares are associated with altered ReHo in frontal (medial prefrontal and inferior frontal), parietal, temporal and occipital regions, as well as some subcortical regions (thalamus). We also found a positive correlation between retrospective disturbed dreaming frequency estimates and ReHo values in the hippocampus. These findings are mostly in line with a recent SPECT study from our laboratory. Our results point to the possibility that a variety of regions, including but not limited to the limbic-prefrontal circuit of our neurocognitive model, contribute to nightmare formation.",NA,NA,NA
33815050,1,"The human brain grows the most dramatically during the perinatal and early post-natal periods, during which pre-term birth or perinatal injury that may alter brain structure and lead to developmental anomalies. Thus, characterizing cortical thickness of developing brains remains an important goal. However, this task is often complicated by inaccurate cortical surface extraction due to small-size brains. Here, we propose a novel complex framework for the reconstruction of neonatal WM and pial surfaces, accounting for large partial volumes due to small-size brains. The proposed approach relies only on T1-weighted images unlike previous T2-weighted image-based approaches while only T1-weighted images are sometimes available under the different clinical/research setting. Deep neural networks are first introduced to the neonatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pipeline to address the mis-segmentation of brain tissues. Furthermore, this pipeline enhances cortical boundary delineation using combined models of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/GM boundary detection with edge gradient information and a new skeletonization of sulcal folding where no CSF voxels are seen due to the limited resolution. We also proposed a systematic evaluation using three independent datasets comprising 736 pre-term and 97 term neonates. Qualitative assessment for reconstructed cortical surfaces shows that 86.9% are rated as accurate across the three site datasets. In addition, our landmark-based evaluation shows that the mean displacement of the cortical surfaces from the true boundaries was less than a voxel size (0.532 ± 0.035 mm). Evaluating the proposed pipeline (namely NEOCIVET 2.0) shows the robustness and reproducibility across different sites and different age-groups. The mean cortical thickness measured positively correlated with post-menstrual age (PMA) at scan (p < 0.0001); Cingulate cortical areas grew the most rapidly whereas the inferior temporal cortex grew the least rapidly. The range of the cortical thickness measured was biologically congruent (1.3 mm at 28 weeks of PMA to 1.8 mm at term equivalent). Cortical thickness measured on T1 MRI using NEOCIVET 2.0 was compared with that on T2 using the established dHCP pipeline. It was difficult to conclude that either T1 or T2 imaging is more ideal to construct cortical surfaces. NEOCIVET 2.0 has been open to the public through CBRAIN (https://mcin-cnim.ca/technology/cbrain/), a web-based platform for processing brain imaging data.",NA,NA,NA

It is a non-invasive research tool that is utilized in neuroscience research and is highly beneficial to the clinical community, especially for the management of neurological diseases, provided that proper equipment and protocols are administered during data acquisition. Although recording EEG-fMRI is apparently straightforward, the correct preparation, especially in placing and securing the electrodes, is not only important for safety but is also critical in ensuring the reliability and analyzability of the EEG data obtained. This is also the most experience-demanding part of the preparation. To address these issues, a straightforward protocol that ensures data quality was developed.

33824310,1,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) can be divided into four phenotypes based on clinical evolution. The pathophysiological boundaries of these phenotypes are unclear, limiting treatment stratification. Machine learning can identify groups with similar features using multidimensional data. Here, to classify MS subtypes based on pathological features, we apply unsupervised machine learning to brain MRI scans acquired in previously published studies. We use a training dataset from 6322 MS patients to define MRI-based subtypes and an independent cohort of 3068 patients for validation. Based on the earliest abnormalities, we define MS subtypes as cortex-led, normal-appearing white matter-led, and lesion-led. People with the lesion-led subtype have the highest risk of confirmed disability progression (CDP) and the highest relapse rate. People with the lesion-led MS subtype show positive treatment response in selected clinical trials. Our findings suggest that MRI-based subtypes predict MS disability progression and response to treatment and may be used to define groups of patients in interventional trials.",NA,NA,NA
33825880,1,"Apraxia of speech is a motor disorder characterized by the impaired ability to coordinate the sequential articulatory movements necessary to produce speech. The critical cortical area(s) involved in speech apraxia remain controversial because many of the previously reported cases had additional aphasic impairments, preventing localization of the specific cortical circuit necessary for the somatomotor execution of speech. Four patients with ""pure speech apraxia"" (i.e., who had no aphasic and orofacial motor impairments) are reported here. The critical lesion in all four patients involved, in the left hemisphere, the precentral gyrus of the insula (gyrus brevis III) and, to a lesser extent, the nearby areas with which it is strongly connected: the adjacent subcentral opercular cortex (part of secondary somatosensory cortex) and the most inferior part of the central sulcus where the orofacial musculature is represented. There was no damage to rostrally adjacent Broca's area in the inferior frontal gyrus. The present study demonstrates the critical circuit for the coordination of complex articulatory movements prior to and during the execution of the motor speech plans. Importantly, this specific cortical circuit is different from those that relate to the cognitive aspects of language production (e.g., Broca's area on the inferior frontal gyrus).",NA,NA,NA

Mean regional SP/CP thickness ratios across age measured on in utero MRI of 25 healthy fetuses (20-33 gestational weeks [GWs]) were correlated with publicly available regional gene expression levels (23-24 GW fetuses).

33850128,1,"The pathophysiology of autism has been suggested to involve a combination of both macroscale connectome miswiring and microcircuit anomalies. Here, we combine connectome-wide manifold learning with biophysical simulation models to understand associations between global network perturbations and microcircuit dysfunctions in autism. We studied neuroimaging and phenotypic data in 47 individuals with autism and 37 typically developing controls obtained from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange initiative. Our analysis establishes significant differences in structural connectome organization in individuals with autism relative to controls, with strong between-group effects in low-level somatosensory regions and moderate effects in high-level association cortices. Computational models reveal that the degree of macroscale anomalies is related to atypical increases of recurrent excitation/inhibition, as well as subcortical inputs into cortical microcircuits, especially in sensory and motor areas. Transcriptomic association analysis based on postmortem datasets identifies genes expressed in cortical and thalamic areas from childhood to young adulthood. Finally, supervised machine learning finds that the macroscale perturbations are associated with symptom severity scores on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Together, our analyses suggest that atypical subcortico-cortical interactions are associated with both microcircuit and macroscale connectome differences in autism.",NA,NA,NA
33852941,1,"The hippocampus is a highly plastic brain structure supporting functions central to human cognition. Morphological changes in the hippocampus have been implicated in development, aging, as well as in a broad range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. A growing body of research suggests that hippocampal plasticity is closely linked to the actions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). However, evidence on the relationship between hippocampal volume (HCV) and peripheral BDNF levels is scarce and limited to elderly and patient populations. Further, despite evidence that BDNF expression differs throughout the hippocampus and is implicated in adult neurogenesis specifically in the dentate gyrus, no study has so far related peripheral BDNF levels to the volumes of individual hippocampal subfields. Besides its clinical implications, BDNF-facilitated hippocampal plasticity plays an important role in regulating cognitive and affective processes. In the current registered report, we investigated how serum BDNF (sBDNF) levels relate to volumes of the hippocampal formation and its subfields in a large sample of healthy adults (N = 279, 160 f) with a broad age range (20-55 years, mean 40.5) recruited in the context of the ReSource Project. We related HCV to basal sBDNF and, in a subsample (n = 103, 57 f), to acute stress-reactive change in sBDNF. We further tested the role of age as a moderator of both associations. Contrary to our hypotheses, neither basal sBDNF levels nor stress-reactive sBDNF change were associated with total HCV or volume of the dentate gyrus/cornu ammonis 4 (DG/CA4) subfield. We also found no evidence for a moderating effect of age on any of these associations. Our null results provide a first point of reference on the relationship between sBDNF and HCV in healthy mid-age, in contrast to patient or aging populations. We suggest that sBDNF levels have limited predictive value for morphological differences of the hippocampal structure when notable challenge to its neuronal integrity or to neurotrophic capacity is absent.",NA,NA,NA

33857141,1,"Information that is encoded in relation to the self has been shown to be better remembered, yet reports have disagreed on whether the memory benefit from self-referential encoding extends to source memory (the context in which information was learned). In this study, we investigated the self-referential effect on source memory in recollection and familiarity-based memory. Using a Remember/Know paradigm, we compared source memory accuracy under self-referential encoding and semantic encoding. Two types of source information were included, a ""peripheral"" source which was not inherent to the encoding activity, and a source information about the encoding context. We observed the facilitation in item memory from self-referential encoding compared to semantic encoding in recollection but not in familiarity-based memory. The self-referential benefit to source accuracy was observed in recollection memory, with source memory for the encoding context being stronger in the self-referential condition. No significant self-referential effect was observed with regards to peripheral source information (information not required for the participant to focus on), suggesting not all source information benefit from self-referential encoding. Self-referential encoding also resulted in a higher ratio of ""Remember/Know"" responses rate than semantically encoded items, denoting stronger recollection. These results suggest self-referential encoding creates a richer, more detailed memory trace which can be recollected later on.",NA,NA,NA
33857618,1,"Technological and data sharing advances have led to a proliferation of high-resolution structural and functional maps of the brain. Modern neuroimaging research increasingly depends on identifying correspondences between the topographies of these maps; however, most standard methods for statistical inference fail to account for their spatial properties. Recently, multiple methods have been developed to generate null distributions that preserve the spatial autocorrelation of brain maps and yield more accurate statistical estimates. Here, we comprehensively assess the performance of ten published null frameworks in statistical analyses of neuroimaging data. To test the efficacy of these frameworks in situations with a known ground truth, we first apply them to a series of controlled simulations and examine the impact of data resolution and spatial autocorrelation on their family-wise error rates. Next, we use each framework with two empirical neuroimaging datasets, investigating their performance when testing (1) the correspondence between brain maps (e.g., correlating two activation maps) and (2) the spatial distribution of a feature within a partition (e.g., quantifying the specificity of an activation map within an intrinsic functional network). Finally, we investigate how differences in the implementation of these null models may impact their performance. In agreement with previous reports, we find that naive null models that do not preserve spatial autocorrelation consistently yield elevated false positive rates and unrealistically liberal statistical estimates. While spatially-constrained null models yielded more realistic, conservative estimates, even these frameworks suffer from inflated false positive rates and variable performance across analyses. Throughout our results, we observe minimal impact of parcellation and resolution on null model performance. Altogether, our findings highlight the need for continued development of statistically-rigorous methods for comparing brain maps. The present report provides a harmonised framework for benchmarking and comparing future advancements.",NA,NA,NA

This study included a total of 188 children, including 62 patients with CECTS taking anti-seizure drugs, 56 patients with drug-naive, and 70 healthy controls. A portion of cases were also followed-up for longitudinal analysis. Cortical morphological parameters were quantitatively measured by applying surface-based morphometry analysis to high-resolution three-dimension T1 weighted images. Among the three groups, the morphological indices were compared to quantify any cortical changes affected by seizures and medication. The relationships among anti-seizure medication, seizure controls and cortical morphometry were investigated using causal mediator analysis. The Rolandic cortex of the drug-naive patients showed abnormal cortical thickness by comparing with that of healthy controls, and thinning by comparing with that of patients with medication. The cortical thickness in the Rolandic regions was negatively correlated with duration of medication and duration of seizure-free. Longitudinal analysis further demonstrated that the thickness of Rolandic cortex thinned in post-medication state relative to the pre-medication state. Mediation analysis revealed that morphological alteration of the Rolandic cortex might act as a mediator in the path of anti-seizure medication on seizure control. Our findings highlighted that anti-seizure medication was associated with regression of abnormal increment of cortical thickness in the Rolandic regions in CECTS.

33876772,1,"The mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates multiple signals to regulate critical cellular processes such as mRNA translation, lipid biogenesis, and autophagy. Germline and somatic mutations in mTOR and genes upstream of mTORC1, such as PTEN, TSC1/2, AKT3, PIK3CA, and components of GATOR1 and KICSTOR complexes, are associated with various epileptic disorders. Increased mTORC1 activity is linked to the pathophysiology of epilepsy in both humans and animal models, and mTORC1 inhibition suppresses epileptogenesis in humans with tuberous sclerosis and animal models with elevated mTORC1 activity. However, the role of mTORC1-dependent translation and the neuronal cell types mediating the effect of enhanced mTORC1 activity in seizures remain unknown. The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and 2 (4E-BP2) are translational repressors downstream of mTORC1. Here we show that the ablation of 4E-BP2, but not 4E-BP1, in mice increases the sensitivity to pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)- and kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures. We demonstrate that the deletion of 4E-BP2 in inhibitory, but not excitatory neurons, causes an increase in the susceptibility to PTZ-induced seizures. Moreover, mice lacking 4E-BP2 in parvalbumin, but not somatostatin or VIP inhibitory neurons exhibit a lowered threshold for seizure induction and reduced number of parvalbumin neurons. A mouse model harboring a human PIK3CA mutation that enhances the activity of the PI3K-AKT pathway (Pik3ca H1047R-Pvalb ) selectively in parvalbumin neurons shows susceptibility to PTZ-induced seizures.

Nutritional risk was assessed with the French version of Seniors in the Community: Risk Evaluation for Eating and Nutrition II (SCREEN II), whereas the severity of dysphagia was assessed using the French-Canadian version of the Sydney Swallow Questionnaire. Anthropometric measurements were performed with standardized procedures.Results: SCREEN II scores showed high nutritional risk for 81.8% of OPMD participants with 6 factors contributing to nutritional risk in at least 50% of the sample. Pearson's correlational analysis showed a significant moderate relationship between dysphagia and nutritional risk (r = -0.470; P = 0.006).Conclusion: To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the nutritional risk of adults with OPMD.

33879872,1,"In Parkinson disease (PD), pathological processes and neurodegeneration begin long before the cardinal motor symptoms develop and enable clinical diagnosis. In this prodromal phase, risk and prodromal markers can be used to identify individuals who are likely to develop PD, as in the recently updated International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society research criteria for prodromal PD. However, increasing evidence suggests that clinical and prodromal PD are heterogeneous, and can be classified into subtypes with different clinical manifestations, pathomechanisms and patterns of spatial and temporal progression in the CNS and PNS. Genetic, pathological and imaging markers, as well as motor and non-motor symptoms, might define prodromal subtypes of PD. Moreover, concomitant pathology or other factors, including amyloid-β and tau pathology, age and environmental factors, can cause variability in prodromal PD. Patients with REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) exhibit distinct patterns of α-synuclein pathology propagation and might indicate a body-first subtype rather than a brain-first subtype.

33885965,1,"Efficient neural transmission is crucial for optimal brain function, yet the plastic potential of white matter (WM) has long been overlooked. Growing evidence now shows that modifications to axons and myelin occur not only as a result of long-term learning, but also after short training periods. Motor sequence learning (MSL), a common paradigm used to study neuroplasticity, occurs in overlapping learning stages and different neural circuits are involved in each stage. However, most studies investigating short-term WM plasticity have used a pre-post design, in which the temporal dynamics of changes across learning stages cannot be assessed. In this study, we used multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at 7 T to investigate changes in WM in a group learning a complex visuomotor sequence (LRN) and in a control group (SMP) performing a simple sequence, for five consecutive days. Consistent with behavioral results, where most improvements occurred between the two first days, structural changes in WM were observed only in the early phase of learning (d1-d2), and in overall learning (d1-d5). In LRNs, WM microstructure was altered in the tracts underlying the primary motor and sensorimotor cortices. Moreover, our structural findings in WM were related to changes in functional connectivity, assessed with resting-state functional MRI data in the same cohort, through analyses in regions of interest (ROIs). Significant changes in WM microstructure were found in a ROI underlying the right supplementary motor area. Together, our findings provide evidence for highly dynamic WM plasticity in the sensorimotor network during short-term MSL.",NA,NA,NA

33906899,1,"Everyday decision-making commonly involves assigning values to complex objects with multiple value-relevant attributes. Drawing on object recognition theories, we hypothesized two routes to multiattribute evaluation: assessing the value of the whole object based on holistic attribute configuration or summing individual attribute values. In two samples of healthy human male and female participants undergoing eye tracking and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while evaluating novel pseudo objects, we found evidence for both forms of evaluation. Fixations to and transitions between attributes differed systematically when the value of pseudo objects was associated with individual attributes or attribute configurations. Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and perirhinal cortex were engaged when configural processing was required. These results converge with our recent findings that individuals with vmPFC lesions were impaired in decisions requiring configural evaluation but not when evaluating the sum of the parts. This suggests that multiattribute decision-making engages distinct evaluation mechanisms relying on partially dissociable neural substrates, depending on the relationship between attributes and value.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Decision neuroscience has only recently begun to address how multiple choice-relevant attributes are brought together during evaluation and choice among complex options. Object recognition research makes a crucial distinction between individual attribute and holistic/configural object processing, but how the brain evaluates attributes and whole objects remains unclear. Using fMRI and eye tracking, we found that the vmPFC and the perirhinal cortex contribute to value estimation specifically when value was related to whole objects, that is, predicted by the unique configuration of attributes and not when value was predicted by the sum of individual attribute values. This perspective on the interactions between subjective value and object processing mechanisms provides a novel bridge between the study of object recognition and reward-guided decision-making.",NA,NA,NA

33939243,1,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with abnormal cerebral perfusion at wakefulness, but whether these anomalies evolve over time is unknown. Here, we examined longitudinal changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) distribution in late middle-aged and older adults with treated or untreated OSA. Twelve controls (64.8 ± 8.0 years) and 23 participants with newly diagnosed OSA (67.8 ± 6.2 years) were evaluated with polysomnography and cerebral 99m Tc-HMPAO single-photon emission computed tomography during wakeful rest. OSA participants were referred to a sleep apnea clinic and 13 of them decided to start continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Participants were tested again after 18 months. Voxel-based analysis and extracted relative rCBF values were used to assess longitudinal changes. Untreated OSA participants showed decreased relative rCBF in the left hippocampus and the right parahippocampal gyrus over time, while treated participants showed trends for increased relative rCBF in the left hippocampus and the right parahippocampal gyrus. No changes were found over time in controls. Untreated OSA is associated with worsening relative rCBF in specific brain areas over time, while treated OSA shows the opposite. Considering that OSA possibly accelerates cognitive decline in older adults, CPAP treatment could help reduce risk for cognitive impairment.",NA,NA,NA

33945886,1,"Sedentary behavior increases the risk for multiple chronic diseases, early mortality, and accelerated cognitive decline in older adults. Interventions to reduce sedentary behavior among older adults are needed to improve health outcomes and reduce the burden on healthcare systems. We designed a randomized controlled trial that uses a self-affirmation manipulation and gain-framed health messaging to effectively reduce sedentary behavior in older adults. This message-based intervention lasts 6 weeks, recruiting 80 healthy but sedentary older adults from the community, between the ages of 60 and 95 years. Participants are randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) an intervention group, which receives self-affirmation followed by gain-framed health messages daily or 2) a control group, which receives daily loss-framed health messages only. Objective physical activity engagement is measured by accelerometers. Accelerometers are deployed a week before, during, and the last week of intervention to examine potential changes in sedentary time and physical activity engagement. Participants undertake structural and functional (resting and task-based) MRI scans, neuropsychological tests, computerized behavioral measures, and neurobehavioral inventories at baseline and after the intervention. A 3-month follow-up assesses the long-term maintenance of any engendered behaviors from the intervention period. This study will assess the effectiveness of a novel behavioral intervention at reducing sedentarism in older adults and examine the neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying any such changes.",NA,NA,NA
33951322,1,To determine if properties of epileptic networks could be delineated using interictal spike propagation seen on stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) and if these properties could predict surgical outcome in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.,OBJECTIVE,NA,NA
33951322,2,"We studied the SEEG of 45 consecutive drug-resistant epilepsy patients who underwent subsequent epilepsy surgery: 18 patients with good post-surgical outcome (Engel I) and 27 with poor outcome (Engel II-IV). Epileptic networks were derived from interictal spike propagation; these networks described the generation and propagation of interictal epileptic activity. We compared the regions in which spikes were frequent and the regions responsible for generating spikes to the area of resection and post-surgical outcome. We developed a measure termed source spike concordance, which integrates information about both spike rate and region of spike generation.",METHODS,NA,NA
33951322,3,"Inclusion in the resection of regions with high spike rate is associated with good post-surgical outcome (sensitivity = 0.82, specificity = 0.73). Inclusion in the resection of the regions responsible for generating interictal epileptic activity independently of rate is also associated with good post-surgical outcome (sensitivity = 0.88, specificity = 0.82). Finally, when integrating the spike rate and the generators, we find that the source spike concordance measure has strong predictability (sensitivity = 0.91, specificity = 0.94).",RESULTS,NA,NA

33951504,1,"The Small Optic Lobe (SOL) family of calpains are intracellular cysteine proteases that are expressed in the nervous system and play an important role in neuronal development in both Drosophila, where loss of this calpain leads to the eponymous small optic lobes, and in mouse and human, where loss of this calpain leads to eye anomalies. Some human individuals with biallelic variants in CAPN15 also have developmental delay and autism. However, neither the specific effect of the loss of the Capn15 protein on brain development nor the brain regions where this calpain is expressed in the adult is known. Here we show using small animal MRI that mice with the complete loss of Capn15 have smaller brains overall with larger decreases in the thalamus and subregions of the hippocampus. These losses are not seen in Capn15 conditional knockout (KO) mice where Capn15 is knocked out only in excitatory neurons in the adult. Based on β-galactosidase expression in an insert strain where lacZ is expressed under the control of the Capn15 promoter, we show that Capn15 is expressed in adult mice, particularly in neurons involved in plasticity such as the hippocampus, lateral amygdala and Purkinje neurons, and partially in other non-characterized cell types. The regions of the brain in the adult where Capn15 is expressed do not correspond well to the regions of the brain most affected by the complete knockout suggesting distinct roles of Capn15 in brain development and adult brain function.",NA,NA,NA

33955195,1,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has its origins in the atypical development of brain networks. Infants who are at high familial risk for, and later diagnosed with ASD, show atypical activity in multiple electroencephalography (EEG) oscillatory measures. However, infant-sibling studies are often constrained by small sample sizes. We used the International Infant EEG Data Integration Platform, a multi-site dataset with 432 participants, including 222 at high-risk for ASD, from whom repeated measurements of EEG were collected between the ages of 3-36 months. We applied a latent growth curve model to test whether familial risk status predicts developmental trajectories of spectral power across the first 3 years of life, and whether these trajectories predict ASD outcome. Change in spectral EEG power in all frequency bands occurred during the first 3 years of life. Familial risk, but not a later diagnosis of ASD, was associated with reduced power at 3 months, and a steeper developmental change between 3 and 36 months in nearly all absolute power bands. ASD outcome was not associated with absolute power intercept or slope. No associations were found between risk or outcome and relative power. This study applied an analytic approach not used in previous prospective biomarker studies of ASD, which was modeled to reflect the temporal relationship between genetic susceptibility, brain development, and ASD diagnosis. Trajectories of spectral power appear to be predicted by familial risk; however, spectral power does not predict diagnostic outcome above and beyond familial risk status. Discrepancies between current results and previous studies are discussed. LAY SUMMARY: Infants with an older sibling who is diagnosed with ASD are at increased risk of developing ASD themselves. This article tested whether EEG spectral power in the first year of life can predict whether these infants did or did not develop ASD.",NA,NA,NA

Little is known about the diagnostic yield of WES in non-Caucasian ataxic populations. Herein, we used WES to investigate a Brazilian cohort of 76 adult patients with idiopathic ataxia previously screened for trinucleotide expansions in known ataxia genes. We collected clinical and radiological data from each patient. WES was performed following standard procedures. Only variants labeled as pathogenic or likely pathogenic according to American college of medical genetics and genomics (ACMG) criteria were retrieved. We determined the diagnostic yield of WES for the whole cohort and also for subgroups defined according to presence or not of pyramidal signs, peripheral neuropathy, and cerebellar atrophy. There were 41 women and 35 men. Mean age at testing was 48 years. Pyramidal signs, peripheral neuropathy, tremor, and cerebellar atrophy were found in 38.1%, 13.1%, 10.5%, and 68.3% of all subjects, respectively. Diagnostic yield of WES was 35.5%. Thirty-six distinct mutations were found in 20 different genes, determining the diagnosis of 18 autosomal recessive and 9 autosomal dominant ataxias. SACS and SPG7 were the most frequently found underlying genes. WES performed better in the subgroup with vs the subgroup without spasticity (p = 0.005).

33963876,1,"Parkinson's disease (PD) psychosis afflicts over half of patients and poses a significant burden on quality of life. The aetiology of PD psychosis is multifactorial and likely arises from the complex interaction between dopamine replacement therapy and disease state. The 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned common marmoset is a validated model to predict the efficacy of therapeutic compounds for treatment-related complications, including PD psychosis. In this model, psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs) encompass stereotypies that are idiosyncratic in nature and reproducible with each L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylanaline (L-DOPA) administration. In the present study, we sought to expand upon the existing repertoire of PLBs through the characterisation of novel stereotypical behaviours that appear dependent on the environment. We then discuss our findings in the context of clinical reports on stereotypical behaviours termed ""punding"" in subjects with PD, which consists of stereotypical repetitive and senseless behaviours. The poor understanding of the pathophysiology governing punding and consequent lack of effective therapies stand to benefit from enhanced characterisation of these stereotypical behaviours in a validated pre-clinical model. We hope that further characterisation of PLBs in the MPTP-lesioned marmoset will be helpful in the evaluation of interventions that seek to alleviate PD psychosis symptoms.",NA,NA,NA

In recent years, studies have shown that lithium alters several protein PTMs, altering their function, and consequently neuronal physiology. The impetus for this review is to outline the links between lithium's therapeutic mode of action and PTM homeostasis. We first provide an overview of the principal PTMs affected by lithium. We then describe several neuropsychiatric disorders in which PTMs have been implicated as pathogenic. For each of these conditions, we discuss lithium's clinical use and explore the putative mechanism of how it restores PTM homeostasis, and thereby cellular physiology.

33976360,1,"The brain naturally resolves the challenge of integrating auditory and visual signals produced by the same event despite different physical propagation speeds and neural processing latencies. Temporal recalibration manifests in human perception to realign incoming signals across the senses. Recent behavioral studies show it is a fast-acting phenomenon, relying on the most recent exposure to audiovisual asynchrony. Here we show that the physiological mechanism of rapid, context-dependent recalibration builds on interdependent pre-stimulus cortical rhythms in sensory brain regions. Using magnetoencephalography, we demonstrate that individual recalibration behavior is related to subject-specific properties of fast oscillations (>35 Hz) nested within a slower alpha rhythm (8-12 Hz) in auditory cortex. We also show that the asynchrony of a previously presented audiovisual stimulus pair alters the preferred coupling phase of these fast oscillations along the alpha cycle, with a resulting phase-shift amounting to the temporal recalibration observed behaviorally. These findings suggest that cross-frequency coupled oscillations contribute to forming unified percepts across senses.",NA,NA,NA

However, models that rely solely on pre- and postsynaptic activity for synaptic changes have, so far, not been able to account for learning complex tasks that demand credit assignment in hierarchical networks. Here we show that if synaptic plasticity is regulated by high-frequency bursts of spikes, then pyramidal neurons higher in a hierarchical circuit can coordinate the plasticity of lower-level connections. Using simulations and mathematical analyses, we demonstrate that, when paired with short-term synaptic dynamics, regenerative activity in the apical dendrites and synaptic plasticity in feedback pathways, a burst-dependent learning rule can solve challenging tasks that require deep network architectures. Our results demonstrate that well-known properties of dendrites, synapses and synaptic plasticity are sufficient to enable sophisticated learning in hierarchical circuits.",NA,NA,NA

33987680,1,"Up to 80% of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience sleep disturbance. Poor sleep impairs executive functioning (EF), a lifelong difficulty in ASD. Evidence suggests EF difficulties in ASD are exacerbated by poor sleep. We examine whether early childhood sleep disturbances are associated with worsening EF trajectories in school-aged children with ASD. A subsample (n = 217) from the Pathways in ASD longitudinal study was analyzed. The Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire captured sleep duration, onset, and night awakenings before age 5 (mean = 3.5 years). Metacognition (MI) and Behavioral Regulation (BRI) indices, on the Teacher Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning, were used to measure cognitive and affective components of EF respectively at four time-points (7.8-11.8 years). We applied latent growth curve models to examine associations between sleep and EF, accounting for relevant covariates, including school-age sleep (mean = 6.7 years). Sleep traits had different age-related impacts on behavioral regulation, but not metacognition. Longer sleep onset at 3.5 years was associated with a worsening BRI difficulties slope (b = 2.07, p < 0.04), but conversely associated with lower BRI difficulties at 7.7 years (b = -4.14, p = 0.04). A longer sleep onset at 6.7 years was related to higher BRI difficulties at 7.7 years (b = 7.78, p < 0.01). Longer sleep duration at 6.7 years was associated with higher BRI difficulties at age 7.7 (b = 3.15, p = 0.01), but subscale analyses revealed shorter sleep duration at age 6.7 was linked to a worsening inhibition slope (b = -0.60, p = 0.01).

33989814,1,"Many everyday tasks share high-level sensory goals but differ in the movements used to accomplish them. One example of this is musical pitch regulation, where the same notes can be produced using the vocal system or a musical instrument controlled by the hands. Cello playing has previously been shown to rely on brain structures within the singing network for performance of single notes, except in areas related to primary motor control, suggesting that the brain networks for auditory feedback processing and sensorimotor integration may be shared (Segado et al. 2018). However, research has shown that singers and cellists alike can continue singing/playing in tune even in the absence of auditory feedback (Chen et al. 2013, Kleber et al. 2013), so different paradigms are required to test feedback monitoring and control mechanisms. In singing, auditory pitch feedback perturbation paradigms have been used to show that singers engage a network of brain regions including anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), anterior insula (aINS), and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) when compensating for altered pitch feedback, and posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) and supramarginal gyrus (SMG) when ignoring it (Zarate et al. 2005, 2008). To determine whether the brain networks for cello playing and singing directly overlap in these sensory-motor integration areas, in the present study expert cellists were asked to compensate for or ignore introduced pitch perturbations when singing/playing during fMRI scanning. We found that cellists were able to sing/play target tones, and compensate for and ignore introduced feedback perturbations equally well. Brain activity overlapped for singing and playing in IPS and SMG when compensating, and pSTG and dPMC when ignoring; differences between singing/playing across all three conditions were most prominent in M1, centered on the relevant motor effectors (hand, larynx). These findings support the hypothesis that pitch regulation during cello playing relies on structures within the singing network and suggests that differences arise primarily at the level of forward motor control.",NA,NA,NA
33991695,1,"Neuronal variability patterns promote the formation and organization of neural circuits. Macroscale similarities in regional variability patterns may therefore be linked to the strength and topography of inter-regional functional connections. To assess this relationship, we used multi-echo resting-state fMRI and investigated macroscale connectivity-variability associations in 154 adult humans (86 women; mean age = 22yrs). We computed inter-regional measures of moment-to-moment BOLD signal variability and related them to inter-regional functional connectivity. Region pairs that showed stronger functional connectivity also showed similar BOLD signal variability patterns, independent of inter-regional distance and structural similarity. Connectivity-variability associations were predominant within all networks and followed a hierarchical spatial organization that separated sensory, motor and attention systems from limbic, default and frontoparietal control association networks. Results were replicated in a second held-out fMRI run. These findings suggest that macroscale BOLD signal variability is an organizational feature of large-scale functional networks, and shared inter-regional BOLD signal variability may underlie macroscale brain network dynamics.",NA,NA,NA

34002096,1,"Bipolar disorder is a heritable mental illness with complex etiology. We performed a genome-wide association study of 41,917 bipolar disorder cases and 371,549 controls of European ancestry, which identified 64 associated genomic loci. Bipolar disorder risk alleles were enriched in genes in synaptic signaling pathways and brain-expressed genes, particularly those with high specificity of expression in neurons of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Significant signal enrichment was found in genes encoding targets of antipsychotics, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptics and anesthetics. Integrating expression quantitative trait locus data implicated 15 genes robustly linked to bipolar disorder via gene expression, encoding druggable targets such as HTR6, MCHR1, DCLK3 and FURIN. Analyses of bipolar disorder subtypes indicated high but imperfect genetic correlation between bipolar disorder type I and II and identified additional associated loci. Together, these results advance our understanding of the biological etiology of bipolar disorder, identify novel therapeutic leads and prioritize genes for functional follow-up studies.",NA,NA,NA
34002691,1,"Both healthy aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are characterized by concurrent alterations in several biological factors. However, generative brain models of aging and AD are limited in incorporating the measures of these biological factors at different spatial resolutions. Here, we propose a personalized bottom-up spatiotemporal brain model that accounts for the direct interplay between hundreds of RNA transcripts and multiple macroscopic neuroimaging modalities (PET, MRI). In normal elderly and AD participants, the model identifies top genes modulating tau and amyloid-β burdens, vascular flow, glucose metabolism, functional activity, and atrophy to drive cognitive decline. The results also revealed that AD and healthy aging share specific biological mechanisms, even though AD is a separate entity with considerably more altered pathways. Overall, this personalized model offers novel insights into the multiscale alterations in the elderly brain, with important implications for identifying effective genetic targets for extending healthy aging and treating AD progression.",NA,NA,NA
34002916,1,"Interactions between interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and distant cortical regions subserve potential effects on cognition of patients with focal epilepsy. We hypothesize that ""healthy"" brain areas at a distance from the epileptic focus may respond to the interference of IEDs by generating inhibitory alpha and beta oscillations. We predict that more prominent alpha-beta oscillations can be found in patients with less impaired neurocognitive profile. We performed a source imaging magnetoencephalography study, including 41 focal epilepsy patients: 21 with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) and 20 with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. We investigated the effect of anterior (i.e., frontal and temporal) IEDs on the oscillatory pattern over posterior head regions. We compared cortical oscillations (5-80 Hz) temporally linked to 3,749 IEDs (1,945 frontal and 1,803 temporal) versus an equal number of IED-free segments. We correlated results from IED triggered oscillations to global neurocognitive performance. Only frontal IEDs triggered alpha-beta oscillations over posterior head regions. IEDs with higher amplitude triggered alpha-beta oscillations of higher magnitude. The intensity of posterior head region alpha-beta oscillations significantly correlated with a better neuropsychological profile. Our study demonstrated that cerebral cortex protects itself from IEDs with generation of inhibitory alpha-beta oscillations at distant cortical regions. The association of more prominent oscillations with a better cognitive status suggests that this mechanism might play a role in determining the cognitive resilience in patients with FLE.",NA,NA,NA
34003336,1,"Loss of nuclear SMARCB1 (INI1/hSNF5/BAF47) protein expression due to biallelic mutations of the SMARCB1 tumor suppressor gene is a hallmark of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (ATRT), but the presence of cytoplasmic SMARCB1 protein in these tumors has not yet been described. In a series of 102 primary ATRT, distinct cytoplasmic SMARCB1 staining on immunohistochemistry was encountered in 19 cases (19%) and was highly over-represented in cases showing pathogenic sequence variants leading to truncation or mutation of the C-terminal part of SMARCB1 (15/19 vs. 4/83; Chi-square: 56.04, p = 1.0E-10) and, related to this, in tumors of the molecular subgroup ATRT-TYR (16/36 vs. 3/66; Chi-square: 24.47, p = 7.6E-7). Previous reports have indicated that while SMARCB1 lacks a bona fide nuclear localization signal, it harbors a masked nuclear export signal (NES) and that truncation of the C-terminal region results in unmasking of this NES leading to cytoplasmic localization. To determine if cytoplasmic localization found in ATRT is due to unmasking of NES, we generated GFP fusions of one of the SMARCB1 truncating mutations (p.Q318X) found in the tumors along with a p.L266A mutation, which was shown to disrupt the interaction of SMARCB1-NES with exportin-1. We found that while the GFP-SMARCB1(Q318X) mutant localized to the cytoplasm, the double mutant GFP-SMARCB1(Q318X;L266A) localized to the nucleus, confirming NES requirement for cytoplasmic localization. Furthermore, cytoplasmic SMARCB1(Q318X) was unable to cause senescence as determined by morphological observations and by senescence-associated β-galactosidase assay, while nuclear SMARCB1(Q318X;L266A) mutant regained this function. Selinexor, a selective exportin-1 inhibitor, was effective in inhibiting the nuclear export of SMARCB1(Q318X) and caused rapid cell death in rhabdoid tumor cells. In conclusion, inhibition of nuclear export restores nuclear localization and residual tumor suppressor function of truncated SMARCB1. Therapies aimed at preventing nuclear export of mutant SMARCB1 protein may represent a promising targeted therapy in ATRT harboring truncating C-terminal SMARCB1 mutations.",NA,NA,NA

This vision extends beyond efforts by individual scientists seeking to release individual datasets, software tools, or building platforms that provide for the free dissemination of such information. It involves multiple stakeholders and an infrastructure that considers governance, ethics, computational resourcing, physical design, workflows, training, education, and intra-institutional reporting structures. The C-BIG repository was built in response as The Neuro's institutional biospecimen and clinical data repository, and collects biospecimens as well as clinical, imaging, and genetic data from patients with neurological disease and healthy controls. It is aimed at helping scientific investigators, in both academia and industry, advance our understanding of neurological diseases and accelerate the development of treatments. As many neurological diseases are quite rare, they present several challenges to researchers due to their small patient populations. Overcoming these challenges required the aggregation of datasets from various projects and locations. The C-BIG repository achieves this goal and stands as a scalable working model for institutions to collect, track, curate, archive, and disseminate multimodal data from patients. In November 2020, a Registered Access layer was made available to the wider research community at https://cbigr-open.loris.ca , and in May 2021 fully open data will be released to complement the Registered Access data.

Such studies are conducted using different smoothing levels and parcellations at the preprocessing stage, on which their results are dependent. However, the impact of these parameters on the relationship between association values and prediction accuracy is not established. In this study, we used cortical thickness and its relationship with age to investigate how different smoothing and parcellation levels affect the detection of age-related brain correlates as well as brain age prediction accuracy. Our main measures were resel numbers-resolution elements-and age-related variance explained. Using these common measures enabled us to directly compare parcellation and smoothing effects in both association and prediction studies. In our sample of N = 608 participants with age range 18-88, we evaluated age-related cortical thickness changes as well as brain age prediction. We found a negative relationship between prediction performance and correlation values for both parameters.

34035140,1,"A successful class of models link decision-making to brain signals by assuming that evidence accumulates to a decision threshold. These evidence accumulation models have identified neuronal activity that appears to reflect sensory evidence and decision variables that drive behavior. More recently, an additional evidence-independent and time-variant signal, called urgency, has been hypothesized to accelerate decisions in the face of insufficient evidence. However, most decision-making paradigms tested with fMRI or EEG in humans have not been designed to disentangle evidence accumulation from urgency. Here we use a face-morphing decision-making task in combination with EEG and a hierarchical Bayesian model to identify neural signals related to sensory and decision variables, and to test the urgency-gating model. Forty females and 34 males took part (mean age, 23.4 years). We find that an evoked potential time locked to the decision, the centroparietal positivity, reflects the decision variable from the computational model. We further show that the unfolding of this signal throughout the decision process best reflects the product of sensory evidence and an evidence-independent urgency signal. Urgency varied across subjects, suggesting that it may represent an individual trait. Our results show that it is possible to use EEG to distinguish neural signals related to sensory evidence accumulation, decision variables, and urgency. These mechanisms expose principles of cognitive function in general and may have applications to the study of pathologic decision-making such as in impulse control and addictive disorders.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Perceptual decisions are often described by a class of models that assumes that sensory evidence accumulates gradually over time until a decision threshold is reached. In the present study, we demonstrate that an additional urgency signal impacts how decisions are formed. This endogenous signal encourages one to respond as time elapses. We found that neural decision signals measured by EEG reflect the product of sensory evidence and an evidence-independent urgency signal. A nuanced understanding of human decisions, and the neural mechanisms that support it, can improve decision-making in many situations and potentially ameliorate dysfunction when it has gone awry.",NA,NA,NA
34037726,1,"Musical training is thought to be related to improved language skills, for example, understanding speech in background noise. Although studies have found that musicians and nonmusicians differed in morphology of bilateral arcuate fasciculus (AF), none has associated such white matter features with speech-in-noise (SIN) perception. Here, we tested both SIN and the diffusivity of bilateral AF segments in musicians and nonmusicians using diffusion tensor imaging. Compared with nonmusicians, musicians had higher fractional anisotropy (FA) in the right direct AF and lower radial diffusivity in the left anterior AF, which correlated with SIN performance. The FA-based laterality index showed stronger right lateralization of the direct AF and stronger left lateralization of the posterior AF in musicians than nonmusicians, with the posterior AF laterality predicting SIN accuracy. Furthermore, hemodynamic activity in right superior temporal gyrus obtained during a SIN task played a full mediation role in explaining the contribution of the right direct AF diffusivity on SIN performance, which therefore links training-related white matter plasticity, brain hemodynamics, and speech perception ability. Our findings provide direct evidence that differential microstructural plasticity of bilateral AF segments may serve as a neural foundation of the cross-domain transfer effect of musical experience to speech perception amid competing noise.",NA,NA,NA

34054436,1,"Wide-field Optical Imaging of Intrinsic Signals (OI-IS; Grinvald et al., 1986) is a method for imaging functional brain hemodynamic responses, mainly used to image activity from the surface of the cerebral cortex. It localizes small functional modules - such as cortical columns - with great spatial resolution and spatial specificity relative to the site of increases in neuronal activity. OI-IS is capable of imaging responses either through an intact or thinned skull or following a craniotomy. Therefore, it is minimally invasive, which makes it ideal for survival experiments. Here we describe OI-IS-based methods for guiding microinjections of optogenetics viral vectors in proximity to small functional modules (S1 barrels) of the cerebral cortex and for guiding the insertion of electrodes for electrophysiological recording into such modules. We validate our proposed methods by tissue processing of the cerebral barrel field area, revealing the track of the electrode in a predetermined barrel. In addition, we demonstrate the use of optical imaging to visualize the spatial extent of the optogenetics photostimulation, making it possible to estimate one of the two variables that conjointly determine which region of the brain is stimulated. Lastly, we demonstrate the use of OI-IS at high-magnification for imaging the upper recording contacts of a laminar probe, making it possible to estimate the insertion depth of all contacts relative to the surface of the cortex.

We show that several neuronal populations can be found examining the spectrotemporal characteristics of their STRFs, and demonstrate how these can be used to generate tonotopic gradient maps. In doing so, we show that the spatial resolution of MEG is sufficient to reliably extract important information about the spatial organization of the auditory cortex, while enabling the analysis of complex temporal dynamics of auditory processing such as best temporal modulation rate and response latency given its excellent temporal resolution. Furthermore, because spectrotemporally dense auditory stimuli can be used with MEG, the time required to acquire the necessary data to generate tonotopic maps is significantly less for MEG than for other neuroimaging tools that acquire BOLD-like signals.",NA,NA,NA

These high ability individuals (HCA) showed an average advantage of 33 IQ points, on a fluid reasoning test they completed for this research, over those other recruited because of their average cognitive ability (ACA). Next, brain age was computed at the individual level for two distinguishable neocortical features (thickness and surface area) according to models trained in an independent large-scale sample of 2377 individuals. Results revealed a stronger pattern of accelerated brain aging in HCA compared to ACA individuals for thickness, while the opposite pattern was suggested for surface area. The findings align well with the greater relevance of individual differences in cortical surface area for enhancing our understanding of cognitive differences at the brain level.",NA,NA,NA
34079125,1,"Compartmentalization is a defining characteristic of eukaryotic cells, and partitions distinct biochemical processes into discrete subcellular locations. Microscopy1 and biochemical fractionation coupled with mass spectrometry2-4 have defined the proteomes of a variety of different organelles, but many intracellular compartments have remained refractory to such approaches. Proximity-dependent biotinylation techniques such as BioID provide an alternative approach to define the composition of cellular compartments in living cells5-7. Here we present a BioID-based map of a human cell on the basis of 192 subcellular markers, and define the intracellular locations of 4,145 unique proteins in HEK293 cells. Our localization predictions exceed the specificity of previous approaches, and enabled the discovery of proteins at the interface between the mitochondrial outer membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum that are crucial for mitochondrial homeostasis. On the basis of this dataset, we created humancellmap.org as a community resource that provides online tools for localization analysis of user BioID data, and demonstrate how this resource can be used to understand BioID results better.",NA,NA,NA
34082116,1,"Many magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures are being studied longitudinally to explore topics such as biomarker detection and clinical staging. A pertinent concern to longitudinal work is MRI scanner upgrades. When upgrades occur during the course of a longitudinal MRI neuroimaging investigation, there may be an impact on the compatibility of pre- and post-upgrade measures. Similarly, subject motion is another issue that may be detrimental to MRI work and embedding volumetric navigators (vNavs) within acquisition sequences has emerged as a technique that allows for prospective motion correction. Our research group recently underwent an upgrade from a Siemens MAGNETOM 3T Tim Trio system to a Siemens MAGNETOM 3T Prisma Fit system. The goals of the current work were to: 1) investigate the impact of this upgrade on commonly used structural imaging measures and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy indices (""Prisma Upgrade protocol"") and 2) examine structural imaging measures in a sequence with vNavs alongside a standard acquisition sequence (""vNav protocol""). While high reliability was observed for most of the investigated MRI outputs, suboptimal reliability was observed for certain indices. Across the scanner upgrade, increases in frontal, temporal, and cingulate cortical thickness (CT) and thalamus volume, along with decreases in parietal CT and amygdala, globus pallidus, hippocampus, and striatum volumes, were observed. No significant impact of the upgrade was found in 1H-MRS analyses. Further, CT estimates were found to be larger in MPRAGE acquisitions compared to vNav-MPRAGE acquisitions mainly within temporal areas, while the opposite was found mostly in parietal brain regions. The results from this work should be considered in longitudinal study designs and comparable prospective motion correction investigations are warranted in cases of marked head movement.",NA,NA,NA
34083537,1,"Bioenergetic perturbations driving neoplastic growth increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), requiring a compensatory increase in ROS scavengers to limit oxidative stress. Intervention strategies that simultaneously induce energetic and oxidative stress therefore have therapeutic potential. Phenformin is a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor that induces bioenergetic stress. We now demonstrate that inflammatory mediators, including IFNγ and polyIC, potentiate the cytotoxicity of phenformin by inducing a parallel increase in oxidative stress through STAT1-dependent mechanisms. Indeed, STAT1 signaling downregulates NQO1, a key ROS scavenger, in many breast cancer models. Moreover, genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of NQO1 using β-lapachone (an NQO1 bioactivatable drug) increases oxidative stress to selectively sensitize breast cancer models, including patient derived xenografts of HER2+ and triple negative disease, to the tumoricidal effects of phenformin. We provide evidence that therapies targeting ROS scavengers increase the anti-neoplastic efficacy of mitochondrial complex I inhibitors in breast cancer.",NA,NA,NA

The objectives of the present study were (a) to identify high-risk trajectories for social wariness and preference for solitude in childhood and (b) to examine whether falling on these high-risk trajectories can be predicted by specific polygenic scores for mental health traits and disorders and by a general polygenic predisposition to these traits.",BACKGROUND,NA,NA

34088878,1,"In most cases, multiple sclerosis (MS) begins with a relapsing-remitting course followed by insidious disability worsening that is independent from clinically apparent relapses and is termed secondary progressive MS (SMPS). Major differences exist between relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and SPMS, especially regarding therapeutic response to treatment. This review provides an overview of the pathology, differentiation, and challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of SPMS. We emphasize the criticality of conversion from a relapsing-remitting to a secondary progressive disease course not only because such conversion is evidence of disability progression, but also because, until recently, treatments that effectively reduced disability progression in relapsing MS were not proven to be effective in SPMS. Clear clinical, imaging, immunologic, or pathologic criteria marking the transition from RRMS to SPMS have not yet been established. Early identification of SPMS will require tools that, together with the use of appropriate treatments, may result in better long-term outcomes for the population of patients with SPMS.",NA,NA,NA
34100349,1,"Schizophrenia has been primarily conceptualized as a disorder of high-order cognitive functions with deficits in executive brain regions. Yet due to the increasing reports of early sensory processing deficit, recent models focus more on the developmental effects of impaired sensory process on high-order functions.

34100349,3,"We demonstrated compression of the cortical hierarchy organization in schizophrenia, with a prominent compression from the sensorimotor region and a less prominent compression from the frontal-parietal region, resulting in a diminished separation between sensory and fronto-parietal cognitive systems. Further analyses suggested reduced differentiation related to atypical functional connectome transition from unimodal to transmodal brain areas. Specifically, we found hypo-connectivity within unimodal regions and hyper-connectivity between unimodal regions and fronto-parietal and ventral attention regions along the classical sensation-to-cognition continuum (voxel-level corrected, p < 0.05).",RESULTS,NA,NA
34100349,4,The compression of cortical hierarchy organization represents a novel and integrative system-level substrate underlying the pathological interaction of early sensory and cognitive function in schizophrenia.

34103360,1,"Neuro-immune interaction during development is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders, but the mechanisms that cause neuronal circuit dysregulation are not well understood. We performed in vivo imaging of the developing retinotectal system in the larval zebrafish to characterize the effects of immune system activation on refinement of an archetypal sensory processing circuit. Acute inflammatory insult induced hyper-dynamic remodeling of developing retinal axons in larval fish and increased axon arbor elaboration over days. Using calcium imaging in GCaMP6s transgenic fish we showed that these morphological changes were accompanied by a shift toward decreased visual acuity in tectal cells. This finding was supported by poorer performance in a visually guided behavioral task. We further found that the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is upregulated by the inflammatory insult, and that down-regulation of IL-1β abrogated the effects of inflammation on axonal dynamics and growth. Moreover, baseline branching of the RGC arbors in IL-1β morphant animals was significantly different from that in control larvae, and their performance in a predation assay was impaired, indicating a role for this cytokine in normal neuronal development. This work establishes a simple and powerful non-mammalian model of developmental immune activation and demonstrates a role for IL-1β in mediating the pathological effects of inflammation on neuronal circuit development.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTMaternal immune activation (MIA) can increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring, however the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Using a non-mammalian vertebrate model of developmental immune activation, we show that even brief activation of inflammatory pathways has immediate and long-term effects on the arborization of axons, and that these morphological changes have functional and behavioral consequences. Finally, we show that the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β plays an essential role in both the effects of inflammation on circuit formation and normal axonal development. Our data add to a growing body of evidence supporting epidemiological studies linking immune activation to neurodevelopmental disorders, and help shed light on the molecular and cellular processes that contribute to the etiology of these disorders.",NA,NA,NA

34115961,1,"Of all the nineteenth-century physicians whose names still resonate today, Armand Trousseau is perhaps the one most familiar, for his description of carpal spasm as a sign of hypocalcemia (Trousseau's sign) and his description of the hypercoagulable state associated with cancer (Trousseau's syndrome). In the last three years of his life, Trousseau turned his attention to aphasia, which he included in his 1864 and 1865 lectures given at Hôtel-Dieu Hospital in Paris and which he discussed in an address to the Imperial Academy of Medicine in 1865. Trousseau preceded Wernicke in describing aphasia as a symptom complex, in which he included Broca's aphemia, receptive aphasia, the inability to read with and without the inability to write (alexia with and without agraphia), the inability to name common objects (amnesic aphasia or anomia) and to recognize numbers (acalculia), and the inability to draw. Trousseau concluded that such a varied symptomatology could not arise from a single area, and he proposed that lesions of the posterior inferior frontal convolution identified by Broca, of the insula and corpus striatum and of the temporal and parietal lobes, could give rise to aphasia. The role of the posterior temporal lobe in receptive aphasia was confirmed by Wernicke in 1874, and the role of the inferior parietal lobule in agraphia and alexia was confirmed by Dejerine in 1891. Trousseau thought that aphasia resulted from the loss of the memory for words and for the synergistic actions of the movements of articulations learned in early childhood. Trousseau added inattention, lack of comprehension, and cognitive decline to amnesia as contributing factors to the verbal and nonverbal expression of thought. Trousseau constructed a comprehensive theory of aphasia that unified its semiology, localization, and pathophysiology. This construct had the virtue of being predictive and falsifiable by the clinico-pathological method. Through insight born of observation, Trousseau identified the issues that dominated aphasiology into the twenty-first century.",NA,NA,NA

We observed an increased differentiation between unimodal and heteromodal association networks in individuals with higher BMI, indicative of a disrupted modular architecture and hierarchy of the brain.

The current study explored intrinsic brain dynamics across the lifespan using resting-state fMRI data (n = 601, 6-85 years) and examined the interactions between age and brain dynamics among three neurocognitive networks (midcingulo-insular network, M-CIN; medial frontoparietal network, M-FPN; and lateral frontoparietal network, L-FPN) in relation to behavioral measures of cognitive flexibility. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis revealed brain dynamics among a brain state characterized by co-activation of the L-FPN and M-FPN, and brain state transitions, moderated the relationship between quadratic effects of age and cognitive flexibility as measured by scores on the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) test. Furthermore, simple slope analyses of significant interactions revealed children and older adults were more likely to exhibit brain dynamic patterns associated with poorer cognitive flexibility compared with younger adults.

We identified three eigenmodes which described gradients in structural connectivity. These gradients reflected inter-regional variations in cortical microstructure derived from quantitative magnetic resonance imaging and postmortem histology. Gradient-informed models accurately predicted macroscale measures of temporal lobe function. Furthermore, the identified gradients aligned closely with established measures of functional reconfiguration and areal expansion between macaques and humans, highlighting their potential role in shaping temporal lobe function throughout primate evolution.

34156977,1,"The majority of patients affected with lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) exhibit neurological symptoms. For mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIC (MPSIIIC), the major burdens are progressive and severe neuropsychiatric problems and dementia, primarily thought to stem from neurodegeneration. Using the MPSIIIC mouse model, we studied whether clinical manifestations preceding massive neurodegeneration arise from synaptic dysfunction. Reduced levels or abnormal distribution of multiple synaptic proteins were revealed in cultured hippocampal and CA1 pyramidal MPSIIIC neurons. These defects were rescued by virus-mediated gene correction. Dendritic spines were reduced in pyramidal neurons of mouse models of MPSIIIC and other (Tay-Sachs, sialidosis) LSD as early as at P10. MPSIIIC neurons also presented alterations in frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents, sparse synaptic vesicles, reduced postsynaptic densities, disorganized microtubule networks, and partially impaired axonal transport of synaptic proteins. Furthermore, postsynaptic densities were reduced in postmortem cortices of human MPS patients, suggesting that the pathology is a common hallmark for neurological LSD. Together, our results demonstrate that lysosomal storage defects cause early alterations in synaptic structure and abnormalities in neurotransmission originating from impaired synaptic vesicular transport, and they suggest that synaptic defects could be targeted to treat behavioral and cognitive defects in neurological LSD patients.",NA,NA,NA

We provide a comprehensive psychometric evaluation of the SAM in younger and older adults. First, we evaluated the reliability of the SAM as a measure of self-perceived recollective capacity. Next, we tested whether the SAM was a valid measure of episodic and autobiographical memory performance, as assessed with widely used performance-based measures. Finally, we investigated associations between the SAM, cognitive measures and self-reported assessments of psychological functioning. The SAM demonstrated reliability as a self-report measure of perceived recollective capacity. High internal consistency was observed across subscales, with the exception of SAM-semantic. Evidence for independence among the subscales was mixed: SAM-episodic and SAM-semantic items showed poor correspondence with respective subscales. Good correspondence was observed between the future and spatial items and their SAM subscales. The SAM showed limited associations with AM performance as measured by the Autobiographical Interview (AI), yet was broadly associated with self-reported AI event vividness. SAM scores were weakly associated with performance-based memory measures and were age-invariant, inconsistent with known age effects on declarative memory. Converging evidence indicated that SAM-episodic and SAM-semantic subscales are not independent and should not be interpreted as specific measures of episodic or semantic memory. The SAM was robustly associated with self-efficacy, suggesting an association with confidence in domain general self-report abilities. We urge caution in the use and interpretation of the SAM as a measure of AM, pending revision and further psychometric validation.",NA,NA,NA

Because it adversely affects every-day life and personal independence, successful rehabilitation of apraxia is essential for personal well-being. Nevertheless, evidence of long-term efficacy of training schemes and generalization to untrained actions is still scarce. One possible reason for the tendency of this neurological disorder to persist may be a deficit in planning, conceptualisation and storage of complex motor acts. This pilot study aims at investigating explicit motor learning in apractic stroke patients. In particular, we addressed the ability of apractic patients to learn and to retain new explicit sequential finger movements across 10 training sessions over a 3-week interval. Nine stroke patients with ideomotor apraxia in its chronic stage participated in a multi-session training regimen and were included in data analyses. Patients performed an explicit finger sequence learning task (MSLT - motor sequence learning task), which is a well-established paradigm to investigate motor learning and memory processes. Patients improved task performance in terms of speed and accuracy across sessions. Specifically, they showed a noticeable reduction in the mean time needed to perform a correct sequence and the number of erroneous sequences. We found also a trend for improved performance at the Goldenberg apraxia test protocol: ""imitation of meaningless hand and finger gestures"" relative to when assessed before the MSLT training. Patients with ideomotor apraxia demonstrated the ability to acquire and maintain a novel sequence of movements; and, this training was associated with hints towards improvement of apraxia symptoms.",NA,NA,NA

Complementing the structural connectome, obtained with diffusion MRI tractography, with a myelin-sensitive measure could result in a more complete model of structural brain connectivity and give better insight into white-matter myeloarchitecture. In this work we weight the connectome by the longitudinal relaxation rate (R1), a measure sensitive to myelin, and then we assess its added value by comparing it with connectomes weighted by the number of streamlines (NOS). Our analysis reveals differences between the two connectomes both in the distribution of their weights and the modular organization. Additionally, the rank-based analysis shows that R1 can be used to separate transmodal regions (responsible for higher-order functions) from unimodal regions (responsible for low-order functions). Overall, the R1-weighted connectome provides a different perspective on structural connectivity taking into account white matter myeloarchitecture.",NA,NA,NA
34192666,1,"To move Alzheimer Disease (AD) research forward it is essential to collect data from large cohorts, but also make such data available to the global research community. We describe the creation of an open science dataset from the PREVENT-AD (PResymptomatic EValuation of Experimental or Novel Treatments for AD) cohort, composed of cognitively unimpaired older individuals with a parental or multiple-sibling history of AD. From 2011 to 2017, 386 participants were enrolled (mean age 63 years old ± 5) for sustained investigation among whom 349 have retrospectively agreed to share their data openly. Repositories are findable through the unified interface of the Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform and contain up to five years of longitudinal imaging data, cerebral fluid biochemistry, neurosensory capacities, cognitive, genetic, and medical information. Imaging data can be accessed openly at https://openpreventad.loris.ca while most of the other information, sensitive by nature, is accessible by qualified researchers at https://registeredpreventad.loris.ca. In addition to being a living resource for continued data acquisition, PREVENT-AD offers opportunities to facilitate understanding of AD pathogenesis.",NA,NA,NA
34215448,1,"A recent study suggested that the p.H63D variant in HFE, a gene involved in iron homeostasis, may modify α-synuclein pathology, the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). If indeed this gene and specific variant are involved in PD, we expect to find differential distribution of HFE variants when comparing PD patients and controls. We analyzed genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from 14,671 PD patients and 17,667 controls and full sequencing data from additional 1647 PD patients and 1050 controls, using logistic regression models, and burden and Kernel tests. The HFE p.H63D variant was not associated with PD, nor did all the other common variants in the HFE locus. We did not find association of rare HFE variants with PD as well in all types of burden and Kernel tests. Our results do not support a role for HFE in PD risk.",NA,NA,NA
34218726,1,"Objective: To evaluate the possible effect of reldesemtiv, a fast skeletal muscle troponin activator, on prescription and acceptance of durable medical equipment (DME) in the FORTITUDE-ALS trial. Methods: Health economic outcome information was collected in FORTITUDE-ALS (NCT03160898); sites recorded if and when DME, specifically manual or power wheelchairs, gastrostomy tubes, noninvasive ventilators, or augmentative language devices, was prescribed by a physician and accepted by the patient (DME-PAP) during the trial. Acceptance was defined as the patient agreeing the item was needed. Cox regression analysis compared time to DME-PAP for each reldesemtiv dose with placebo. Post hoc analyses evaluated all reldesemtiv doses compared with placebo. Results: At least one DME item was prescribed and accepted by 33/114 (28.9%) of placebo patients, 19/112 (17.0%) of patients receiving reldesemtiv 150 mg bid, 24/113 (21.2%) receiving 300 mg bid, and 29/117 (24.8%) receiving 450 mg bid. The proportion of new DME-PAP was significantly lower in patients receiving reldesemtiv 150 mg bid vs placebo (17.0% vs 28.9%, p = 0.032). The hazard ratio versus placebo for accepting at least one DME item for all reldesemtiv doses combined was 0.61 (confidence interval: 0.39, 0.96, p = 0.032). 25% of placebo patients were prescribed and agreed to obtain a DME item by 84 days; this threshold was met for reldesemtiv-treated patients at 120 days. Conclusions: Results suggest ALS patients receiving reldesemtiv may have lower risk of and delayed need for DME related to impaired mobility, breathing, swallowing, or speaking; this delay is consistent with other measures indicating delay in disease progression.",NA,ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT03160898
34224853,1,"Human brain atlases provide spatial reference systems for data characterizing brain organization at different levels, coming from different brains. Cytoarchitecture is a basic principle of the microstructural organization of the brain, as regional differences in the arrangement and composition of neuronal cells are indicators of changes in connectivity and function. Automated scanning procedures and observer-independent methods are prerequisites to reliably identify cytoarchitectonic areas, and to achieve reproducible models of brain segregation. Time becomes a key factor when moving from the analysis of single regions of interest towards high-throughput scanning of large series of whole-brain sections. Here we present a new workflow for mapping cytoarchitectonic areas in large series of cell-body stained histological sections of human postmortem brains. It is based on a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is trained on a pair of section images with annotations, with a large number of un-annotated sections in between. The model learns to create all missing annotations in between with high accuracy, and faster than our previous workflow based on observer-independent mapping. The new workflow does not require preceding 3D-reconstruction of sections, and is robust against histological artefacts. It processes large data sets with sizes in the order of multiple Terabytes efficiently. The workflow was integrated into a web interface, to allow access without expertise in deep learning and batch computing. Applying deep neural networks for cytoarchitectonic mapping opens new perspectives to enable high-resolution models of brain areas, introducing CNNs to identify borders of brain areas.",NA,NA,NA

Here, we consider how our knowledge of the topographic characteristics of the DMN can be leveraged to better understand how this network contributes to cognition and behaviour.",NA,NA,NA
34239424,1,"The involvement of the right hemisphere (RH) in language, and especially after aphasia resulting from left hemisphere (LH) lesions, has been recently highlighted. The present study investigates white matter structure in the right hemisphere of 25 chronic post-stroke aphasic patients after LH lesions in comparison with 24 healthy controls, focusing on the four cortico-cortical tracts that link posterior parietal and temporal language-related areas with Broca's region in the inferior frontal gyrus of the LH: the Superior Longitudinal Fasciculi II and III (SLF II and SLF III), the Arcuate Fasciculus (AF), and the Temporo-Frontal extreme capsule Fasciculus (TFexcF). Additionally, the relationship of these RH white matter tracts to language performance was examined. The patients with post-stroke aphasia in the chronic phase and the healthy control participants underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) examination. The aphasic patients were assessed with standard aphasia tests. The results demonstrated increased axial diffusivity in the RH tracts of the aphasic patients. Patients were then divided according to the extent of the left hemisphere white matter loss. Correlations of language performance with radial diffusivity (RD) in the right hemisphere homologs of the tracts examined were demonstrated for the TFexcF, SLF III, and AF in the subgroup with limited damage to the LH language networks and only with the TFexcF in the subgroup with extensive damage. The results argue in favor of compensatory roles of the right hemisphere tracts in language functions when the LH networks are disrupted.",NA,NA,NA
34246180,1,"A vast array of commercial antibodies covers a large percentage of human gene products, but determining which among them is most appropriate for any given application is challenging. This leads to use of non-specific antibodies that contributes to issues with reproducibility. It is our opinion that the community of scientists who use commercial antibodies in their biomedical research would benefit from third-party antibody characterization entities that use standardized operating procedures to assess and compare antibody performance. Ideally, such entities would follow the principles of open science, such that all antibodies against any given protein target would be tested in parallel, and all data generated released to the public domain without bias. Furthermore, there should be no financial incentive for the entity beyond cost-recovery. Such non-profit organizations, combined with other scientific efforts, could catalyse new discoveries by providing scientists with better validated antibody tools.",NA,NA,NA

To evaluate the association between PTRHD1 and PD risk, we analyzed whole genome sequencing data of 1647 PD cases and 1050 healthy controls, as well as genome-wide imputed genotyping data on 14,671 PD cases and 17,667 controls, all of European ancestry. Furthermore, we examined the association of PTRHD1 with PD risk and AAO using summary statistics data from the most recent PD genome-wide association study meta-analyses.

34247392,1,"Music listening provides one of the most significant abstract rewards for humans because hearing music activates the dopaminergic mesolimbic system. Given the strong link between reward, dopamine, and memory, we aimed here to investigate the hypothesis that dopamine-dependent musical reward can drive memory improvements. Twenty-nine healthy participants of both sexes provided reward ratings of unfamiliar musical excerpts that had to be remembered following a consolidation period under three separate conditions: after the ingestion of a dopaminergic antagonist, a dopaminergic precursor, or a placebo. Linear mixed modeling of the intervention data showed that the effect of reward on memory-i.e., the greater the reward experienced while listening to the musical excerpts, the better the memory recollection performance-was modulated by both dopaminergic signaling and individual differences in reward processing. Greater pleasure was consistently associated with better memory outcomes in participants with high sensitivity to musical reward, but this effect was lost when dopaminergic signaling was disrupted in participants with average or low musical hedonia. Our work highlights the flexibility of the human dopaminergic system, which can enhance memory formation not only through explicit and/or primary reinforcers but also via abstract and aesthetic rewards such as music.",NA,NA,NA
34248822,1,"Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias (ARCAs) form an ultrarare yet expanding group of neurodegenerative multisystemic diseases affecting the cerebellum and other neurological or non-neurological systems. With the advent of targeted therapies for ARCAs, disease registries have become a precious source of real-world quantitative and qualitative data complementing knowledge from preclinical studies and clinical trials. Here, we review the ARCA Registry, a global collaborative multicenter platform (>15 countries, >30 sites) with the overarching goal to advance trial readiness in ARCAs. It presents a good clinical practice (GCP)- and general data protection regulation (GDPR)-compliant professional-reported registry for multicenter web-based capture of cross-center standardized longitudinal data. Modular electronic case report forms (eCRFs) with core, extended, and optional datasets allow data capture tailored to the participating site's variable interests and resources. The eCRFs cover all key data elements required by regulatory authorities [European Medicines Agency (EMA)] and the European Rare Disease (ERD) platform. They capture genotype, phenotype, and progression and include demographic data, biomarkers, comorbidity, medication, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and longitudinal clinician- or patient-reported ratings of ataxia severity, non-ataxia features, disease stage, activities of daily living, and (mental) health status. Moreover, they are aligned to major autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) and sporadic ataxia (SPORTAX) registries in the field, thus allowing for joint and comparative analyses not only across ARCAs but also with SCAs and sporadic ataxias. The registry is at the core of a systematic multi-component ARCA database cluster with a linked biobank and an evolving study database for digital outcome measures. Currently, the registry contains more than 800 patients with almost 1,500 visits representing all ages and disease stages; 65% of patients with established genetic diagnoses capture all the main ARCA genes, and 35% with unsolved diagnoses are targets for advanced next-generation sequencing. The ARCA Registry serves as the backbone of many major European and transatlantic consortia, such as PREPARE, PROSPAX, and the Ataxia Global Initiative, with additional data input from SPORTAX. It has thus become the largest global trial-readiness registry in the ARCA field.",NA,NA,NA

34262511,1,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to mitigate its impact (e.g., confinement orders) have affected people's lives in profound ways that would have been unimagable only months before the pandemic began. Media reports from the height of the pandemic's initial international surge frequently highlighted that many people were engaging in music-related activities (from singing and dancing to playing music from balconies and attending virtual concerts) to help them cope with the strain of the pandemic. Our first goal in this study was to investigate changes in music-related habits due to the pandemic. We also investigated whether engagement in distinct music-related activities (singing, listening, dancing, etc.) was associated with individual differences in musical reward, music perception, musical training, or emotional regulation strategies. To do so, we collected detailed (~1 h-long) surveys during the initial peak of shelter-in-place order implementation (May-June 2020) from over a thousand individuals across different Countries in which the pandemic was especially devastating at that time: the USA, Spain, and Italy. Our findings indicate that, on average, people spent more time in music-related activities while under confinement than they had before the pandemic. Notably, this change in behavior was dependent on individual differences in music reward sensitivity, and in emotional regulation strategies. Finally, the type of musical activity with which individuals engaged was further associated with the degree to which they used music as a way to regulate stress, to address the lack of social interaction (especially the individuals more concerned about the risk of contracting the virus), or to cheer themselves up (especially those who were more worried about the pandemic consequences). Identifying which music-related activities have been particularly sought for by the population as a means for coping with such heightened uncertainty and stress, and understanding the individual differences that underlie said propensities are crucial to implementing personalized music-based interventions that aim to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms.",NA,NA,NA

34280848,1,"The study of the hippocampus across the healthy adult lifespan has rendered inconsistent findings. While volumetric measurements have often been a popular technique for analysis, more advanced morphometric techniques have demonstrated compelling results that highlight the importance and improved specificity of shape-based measures. Here, the MAGeT Brain algorithm was applied on 134 healthy individuals aged 18-81 years old to extract hippocampal subfield volumes and hippocampal shape measurements, namely: local surface area (SA) and displacement. We used linear-, second- or third-order natural splines to examine the relationships between hippocampal measures and age. In addition, partial least squares analyses were performed to relate volume and shape measurements with cognitive and demographic information. Volumetric results indicated a relative preservation of the right cornus ammonis 1 with age and a global volume reduction linked with older age, female sex, lower levels of education and cognitive performance. Vertex-wise analysis demonstrated an SA preservation in the anterior hippocampus with a peak during the sixth decade, while the posterior hippocampal SA gradually decreased across lifespan. Overall, SA decrease was linked to older age, female sex and, to a lesser extent lower levels of education and cognitive performance. Outward displacement in the lateral hippocampus and inward displacement in the medial hippocampus were enlarged with older age, lower levels of cognition and education, indicating an accentuation of the hippocampal ""C"" shape with age. Taken together, our findings suggest that vertex-wise analyses have higher spatial specifity and that sex, education, and cognition are implicated in the differential impact of age on hippocampal subregions throughout its anteroposterior and medial-lateral axes.

Here, we aimed to characterize and quantify the distinct brain morphometry effects and latent dimensions across 8 neuropsychiatric CNVs. We analyzed T1-weighted MRI data from clinically and non-clinically ascertained CNV carriers (deletion/duplication) at the 1q21.1 (n = 39/28), 16p11.2 (n = 87/78), 22q11.2 (n = 75/30), and 15q11.2 (n = 72/76) loci as well as 1296 non-carriers (controls). Case-control contrasts of all examined genomic loci demonstrated effects on brain anatomy, with deletions and duplications showing mirror effects at the global and regional levels. Although CNVs mainly showed distinct brain patterns, principal component analysis (PCA) loaded subsets of CNVs on two latent brain dimensions, which explained 32 and 29% of the variance of the 8 Cohen's d maps. The cingulate gyrus, insula, supplementary motor cortex, and cerebellum were identified by PCA and multi-view pattern learning as top regions contributing to latent dimension shared across subsets of CNVs. The large proportion of distinct CNV effects on brain morphology may explain the small neuroimaging effect sizes reported in polygenic psychiatric conditions.

Abnormal α-synuclein deposition occurs early in the neurodegenerative process across the central and peripheral nervous systems and might precede the appearance of motor symptoms and cognitive decline by several decades. These findings provide the rationale to develop reliable biomarkers that can better predict conversion to clinically manifest α-synucleinopathies. In addition, biomarkers of disease progression will be essential to monitor treatment response once disease-modifying therapies become available, and biomarkers of disease subtype will be essential to enable prediction of which subtype of α-synucleinopathy patients with isolated RBD might develop.",NA,NA,NA
34302967,1,"Metabolic disorders associated with obesity could lead to alterations in brain structure and function. Whether these changes can be reversed after weight loss is unclear. Bariatric surgery provides a unique opportunity to address these questions because it induces marked weight loss and metabolic improvements which in turn may impact the brain in a longitudinal fashion. Previous studies found widespread changes in grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) after bariatric surgery. However, findings regarding changes in spontaneous neural activity following surgery, as assessed with the fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) and regional homogeneity of neural activity (ReHo), are scarce and heterogenous. In this study, we used a longitudinal design to examine the changes in spontaneous neural activity after bariatric surgery (comparing pre- to post-surgery), and to determine whether these changes are related to cardiometabolic variables.",BACKGROUND,NA,NA
34302967,2,"The study included 57 participants with severe obesity (mean BMI=43.1 ± 4.3 kg/m2) who underwent sleeve gastrectomy (SG), biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD), or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), scanned prior to bariatric surgery and at follow-up visits of 4 months (N = 36), 12 months (N = 29), and 24 months (N = 14) after surgery. We examined fALFF and ReHo measures across 1022 cortical and subcortical regions (based on combined Schaeffer-Xiao parcellations) using a linear mixed effect model. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) based on T1-weighted images was also used to measure GM density in the same regions.

The increase within dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, temporal gyrus, and visual cortex was more limited after 12 months and only present in the visual cortex after 24 months. These increases in neural activity measured by fALFF were also significantly associated with the increase in GM density following surgery. Furthermore, the increase in neural activity was significantly related to post-surgery weight loss and improvement in cardiometabolic variables, such as blood pressure. In the independent HCP sample, normal-weight participants had higher global and regional fALFF signals, mainly in dorsolateral/medial frontal cortex, precuneus and middle/inferior temporal gyrus compared to the obese participants. These BMI-related differences in fALFF were associated with the increase in fALFF 4 months post-surgery especially in regions involved in control, default mode and dorsal attention networks.",RESULTS,NA,NA

34305675,1,"Objective: This study examined how best to identify modifiable protective and risk factors for burnout in healthcare workers in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Individual, occupational, organizational and social factors were investigated. The study also assessed the impact of these factors on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. Methods: Healthcare workers in the Quebec (Canada) healthcare system were recruited between May 21 to June 5, 2020. Participants answered an electronic survey 3 months after the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak began in Canada. Using the Maslach Burnout Inventory, PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, we studied the prevalence of burnout, PTSD, anxiety and depression in this cohort. Multivariable logistic or linear regression models including resilience, social and organizational support, workload and access to mental health help, simulation techniques and protective personal equipment (PPE) as well as perception of PPE security were conducted for each outcome. Results: In mid-June 2020, 467 participants completed the survey. We found that half (51.8%) of the respondents experienced burnout characterized by emotional exhaustion and/or depersonalization at least once a week. In total, 158 healthcare workers (35.6%) displayed severe symptoms of at least one of the mental health disorders (24.3% PTSD, 23.3% anxiety, 10.6% depression). Resilience (OR = 0.69, 95% CI: [0.55-0.87]; p = 0.002) and perceived organizational support (OR = 0.75, 95% CI: [0.61-0.93]; p = 0.009) were significantly associated with burnout and other outcomes. Social support satisfaction, perception of PPE security, work type and environment, mental health antecedents and reassignment were associated with PTSD and/or anxiety and/or depression, but not burnout. Conclusion: Future studies should address primarily resilience and perceived organizational support to promote mental health and prevent burnout, PTSD, anxiety and depression.",NA,NA,NA

34314827,1,"By providing a three-dimensional in vitro culture system with key features of the substantia nigra region in the brain, 3D neuronal organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide living neuronal tissue resembling the midbrain region of the brain. However, a major limitation of conventional brain organoid culture is that it is often labor-intensive, requiring highly specialized personnel for moderate throughput. Additionally, the methods published for long-term cultures require time-consuming maintenance to generate brain organoids in large numbers. With the increasing need for human midbrain organoids (hMOs) to better understand and model Parkinson's disease (PD) in a dish, there is a need to implement new workflows and methods to both generate and maintain hMOs, while minimizing batch to batch variation. In this study, we developed a method with microfabricated disks to scale up the generation of hMOs. This opens up the possibility to generate larger numbers of hMOs, in a manner that minimizes the amount of labor required, while decreasing variability and maintaining the viability of these hMOs over time. Taken together, producing hMOs in this manner opens up the potential for these to be used to further PD studies.",NA,NA,NA
34335193,1,"Ependymal cells are ciliated-epithelial glial cells that develop from radial glia along the surface of the ventricles of the brain and the spinal canal. They play a critical role in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) homeostasis, brain metabolism, and the clearance of waste from the brain. These cells have been implicated in disease across the lifespan including developmental disorders, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease. Despite this, ependymal cells remain largely understudied. Using single-cell RNA sequencing data extracted from publicly available datasets, we make key findings regarding the remarkable conservation of ependymal cell gene signatures across age, region, and species. Through this unbiased analysis, we have discovered that one of the most overrepresented ependymal cell functions that we observed relates to a critically understudied role in metal ion homeostasis. Our analysis also revealed distinct subtypes and states of ependymal cells across regions and ages of the nervous system. For example, neonatal ependymal cells maintained a gene signature consistent with developmental processes such as determination of left/right symmetry; while adult ventricular ependymal cells, not spinal canal ependymal cells, appeared to express genes involved in regulating cellular transport and inflammation. Together, these findings highlight underappreciated functions of ependymal cells, which will be important to investigate in order to better understand these cells in health and disease.",NA,NA,NA

In other aspects, structural and diffusion-based models showed similar classification accuracies. Our classification models for patients with hippocampal sclerosis were more accurate (68-76%) than models that stratified non-lesional patients (53-62%).

However, it is unknown whether distinct subtypes of neurons are more sensitive to information carried by synchrony versus rate, or vice versa. Here, we address this question using patterned optical stimulation in slices of somatosensory cortex from mouse lines labelling fast-spiking (FS) and regular-spiking (RS) interneurons. We used optical stimulation in layer 2/3 to encode a 1-bit signal using either the synchrony or rate of activity. We then examined the mutual information between this signal and the interneuron responses. We found that for a synchrony encoding, FS interneurons carried more information in the first five milliseconds, while both interneuron subtypes carried more information than excitatory neurons in later responses. For a rate encoding, we found that RS interneurons carried more information after several milliseconds. These data demonstrate that distinct interneuron subtypes in the neocortex have distinct sensitivities to synchrony versus rate codes.",NA,NA,NA
34355118,1,"One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis is believed to be the production and deposition of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide into extracellular plaques. Existing research indicates that extracellular vesicles (EVs) can carry Aβ associated with AD. However, characterization of the EVs-associated Aβ and its conformational variants has yet to be realized. Raman spectroscopy is a label-free and non-destructive method that is able to assess the biochemical composition of EVs. This study reports for the first time the Raman spectroscopic fingerprint of the Aβ present in the molecular cargo of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). Raman spectra were measured from sEVs isolated from Alzheimer's disease cell culture model, where secretion of Aβ is regulated by tetracycline promoter, and from midbrain organoids. The averaged spectra of each sEV group showed considerable variation as a reflection of the biochemical content of sEVs. Spectral analysis identified more intense Raman peaks at 1650 cm-1 and 2930 cm-1 attributable to the Aβ peptide incorporated in sEVs produced by the Alzheimer's cell culture model. Subsequent analysis of the spectra by principal component analysis differentiated the sEVs of the Alzheimer's disease cell culture model from the control groups of sEVs. Moreover, the results indicate that Aβ associated with secreted sEVs has a α-helical secondary structure and the size of a monomer or small oligomer. Furthermore, by analyzing the lipid content of sEVs we identified altered fatty acid chain lengths in sEVs that carry Aβ that may affect the fluidity of the EV membrane. Overall, our findings provide evidence supporting the use of Raman spectroscopy for the identification and characterization of sEVs associated with potential biomarkers of neurological disorders such as toxic proteins.",NA,NA,NA
34358629,1,"Neurons are very complicated computational devices, incorporating numerous non-linear processes, particularly in their dendrites. Biophysical models capture these processes directly by explicitly modelling physiological variables, such as ion channels, current flow, membrane capacitance, etc. However, another option for capturing the complexities of real neural computation is to use cascade models, which treat individual neurons as a cascade of linear and non-linear operations, akin to a multi-layer artificial neural network. Recent research has shown that cascade models can capture single-cell computation well, but there are still a number of sub-cellular, regenerative dendritic phenomena that they cannot capture, such as the interaction between sodium, calcium, and NMDA spikes in different compartments. Here, we propose that it is possible to capture these additional phenomena using parallel, recurrent cascade models, wherein an individual neuron is modelled as a cascade of parallel linear and non-linear operations that can be connected recurrently, akin to a multi-layer, recurrent, artificial neural network. Given their tractable mathematical structure, we show that neuron models expressed in terms of parallel recurrent cascades can themselves be integrated into multi-layered artificial neural networks and trained to perform complex tasks. We go on to discuss potential implications and uses of these models for artificial intelligence. Overall, we argue that parallel, recurrent cascade models provide an important, unifying tool for capturing single-cell computation and exploring the algorithmic implications of physiological phenomena.",NA,NA,NA

34378224,1,"Diagnostic criteria for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are complex, incorporating multiple levels of certainty from possible through to definite, and are thereby prone to error. Specifically, interrater variability was previously established to be poor, thereby limiting utility as diagnostic enrollment criteria for clinical trials. In addition, the different levels of diagnostic certainty do not necessarily reflect disease progression, adding confusion to the diagnostic algorithm. Realizing these inherent limitations, the World Federation of Neurology, the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology, the International Alliance of ALS/MND Associations, the ALS Association (United States), and the Motor Neuron Disease Association convened a consensus meeting (Gold Coast, Australia, 2019) to consider the development of simpler criteria that better reflect clinical practice, and that could merge diagnostic categories into a single entity. The diagnostic accuracy of the novel Gold Coast criteria was subsequently interrogated through a large cross-sectional study, which established an increased sensitivity for ALS diagnosis when compared with previous criteria. Diagnostic accuracy was maintained irrespective of disease duration, functional status, or site of disease onset. Importantly, the Gold Coast criteria differentiated atypical phenotypes, such as primary lateral sclerosis, from the more typical ALS phenotype. It is proposed that the Gold Coast criteria should be incorporated into routine practice and clinical trial settings.",NA,NA,NA

The bi-functional fusion protein consisted of a blood-brain barrier crossing single domain antibody (FC5) fused to an amyloid-β oligomer-binding peptide (ABP) via Fc fragment of mouse IgG (FC5-mFc2a-ABP). A five-week treatment with FC5-mFc2a-ABP (loading dose of 30 mg/Kg/iv followed by 15 mg/Kg/week/iv for four weeks) substantially reduced brain amyloid-β levels as measured by positron emission tomography and increased the cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β42/40 ratio. In addition, the 5-week treatment rectified the cerebrospinal fluid neurofilament light chain concentrations, resting-state functional connectivity, and hippocampal atrophy measured using magnetic resonance imaging. Finally, FC5-mFc2a-ABP (referred to as KG207-M) treatment did not induce amyloid-related imaging abnormalities such as microhemorrhage.

We have applied this method to different versions of two widely used neuroimaging pipelines (CIVET and FreeSurfer), in terms of coefficients of variation; sensitivity and specificity of detecting lesions in 4 different regions of interest in the cortex, while introducing variations to the lesion size, the blurring kernel used prior to statistical analyses, and different thickness metrics (in CIVET). These variations are tested in a between-subject design (in two random groups, with and without lesions, using T1-weigted MRIs of 152 individuals from the International Consortium of Brain Mapping (ICBM) dataset) and in a within-subject pre-/post-lesion design [using 21 T1-Weighted MRIs of a single adult individual, scanned in the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS)].

Furthermore, to investigate a causal effect in cortical thinning, cell-type-specific depletion was used in a murine model of acquired epilepsy.",METHODS,NA,NA
34388852,3,"We identified elevated fractions of microglia and endothelial cells in regions of reduced cortical thickness. Differentially expressed genes showed enrichment for microglial markers and, in particular, activated microglial states. Analysis of post-mortem brain tissue from humans with epilepsy confirmed excess activated microglia. In the murine model, transient depletion of activated microglia during the early phase of the disease development prevented cortical thinning and neuronal cell loss in the temporal cortex. Although the development of chronic seizures was unaffected, the epileptic mice with early depletion of activated microglia did not develop deficits in a non-spatial memory test seen in epileptic mice not depleted of microglia.",RESULTS,NA,NA

34390415,1,"We present a brief commentary on the field's search for an anatomical asymmetry between Broca's area and its homologue in the non-dominant hemisphere, focusing on a selection of studies, including research from the last decade. We demonstrate that, several years after the influential review of Keller and colleagues from 2009, and despite recent advances in neuroimaging, the existence of a structural asymmetry of Broca's area is still controversial. This is especially the case for studies of the macroanatomy of this region. We point out the inconsistencies in methodology across studies that could account for the discrepancy in results. Investigations of the microstructure of Broca's area show a trend of a leftward asymmetry, but it is still unclear how these results relate to language dominance. We suggest that it may be necessary to combine multiple metrics in a systematic manner to find robust asymmetries and to expand the regional scope of structural investigations. Finally, based on the current state of the literature, we should not rule out the possibility that language dominance may simply not be reflected in local anatomical differences in the brain.",NA,NA,NA

Although there was no significant main effect of NVIQ, there was a significant interaction between age and NVIQ. This was mainly driven by Difficulties with change in routine, for which higher NVIQ was associated with the behavior remaining relatively stable with age, while lower NVIQ was associated with the behavior becoming more prevalent with age.",RESULTS,NA,NA

34395528,1,"RNA polymerase (Pol) III transcribes small untranslated RNAs such as 5S ribosomal RNA, transfer RNAs, and U6 small nuclear RNA. Because of the functions of these RNAs, Pol III transcription is best known for its essential contribution to RNA maturation and translation. Surprisingly, it was discovered in the last decade that various inherited mutations in genes encoding nine distinct subunits of Pol III cause tissue-specific diseases rather than a general failure of all vital functions. Mutations in the POLR3A, POLR3C, POLR3E and POLR3F subunits are associated with susceptibility to varicella zoster virus-induced encephalitis and pneumonitis. In addition, an ever-increasing number of distinct mutations in the POLR3A, POLR3B, POLR1C and POLR3K subunits cause a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases, which includes most notably hypomyelinating leukodystrophy. Furthermore, other rare diseases are also associated with mutations in genes encoding subunits of Pol III (POLR3H, POLR3GL) and the BRF1 component of the TFIIIB transcription initiation factor. Although the causal relationship between these mutations and disease development is widely accepted, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis remain enigmatic. Here, we review the current knowledge on the functional impact of specific mutations, possible Pol III-related disease-causing mechanisms, and animal models that may help to better understand the links between Pol III mutations and disease.",NA,NA,NA
34400529,1,"A more thorough description of the changes in synaptic strength underlying synaptic plasticity may be achieved with quantal resolution measurements at individual synaptic sites. Here, we demonstrate that by using a membrane targeted genetic calcium sensor, we can measure quantal synaptic events at the individual synaptic sites of Aplysia sensory neuron to motor neuron synaptic connections. These results show that synaptic strength is not evenly distributed between all contacts in these cultures, but dominated by multiquantal sites of synaptic contact, likely clusters of individual synaptic sites. Surprisingly, most synaptic contacts were not found opposite presynaptic varicosities, but instead at areas of pre- and postsynaptic contact with no visible thickening of membranes. The release probability, quantal size, and quantal content can be measured over days at individual synaptic contacts using this technique. Homosynaptic depression was accompanied by a reduction in release site probability, with no evidence of individual synaptic site silencing over the course of depression. This technique shows promise in being able to address outstanding questions in this system, including determining the synaptic changes that maintain long-term alterations in synaptic strength that underlie memory.",NA,NA,NA

Using intracranial recordings across the entire human auditory cortex, electrocortical stimulation, and surgical ablation, we show that cortical processing across areas is not consistent with a serial hierarchical organization. Instead, response latency and receptive field analyses demonstrate parallel and distinct information processing in the primary and nonprimary auditory cortices. This functional dissociation was also observed where stimulation of the primary auditory cortex evokes auditory hallucination but does not distort or interfere with speech perception. Opposite effects were observed during stimulation of nonprimary cortex in superior temporal gyrus. Ablation of the primary auditory cortex does not affect speech perception. These results establish a distributed functional organization of parallel information processing throughout the human auditory cortex and demonstrate an essential independent role for nonprimary auditory cortex in speech processing.",NA,NA,NA

We sought to clinically characterize PD patients of Costa Rican origin and to sequence familial PD and atypical parkinsonism-associated genes in cases and controls. Methods: We enrolled 118 PD patients with 97 unrelated controls. Collected information included demographics, exposure to risk and protective factors, and motor and cognitive assessments. We sequenced coding and untranslated regions in familial PD and atypical parkinsonism-associated genes including GBA, SNCA, VPS35, LRRK2, GCH1, PRKN, PINK1, DJ-1, VPS13C, and ATP13A2. Results: Mean age of PD probands was 62.12 ± 13.51 years; 57.6% were male. The frequency of risk and protective factors averaged ~45%. Physical activity significantly correlated with better motor performance despite years of disease. Increased years of education were significantly associated with better cognitive function, whereas hallucinations, falls, mood disorders, and coffee consumption correlated with worse cognitive performance. We did not identify an association between tested genes and PD or any damaging homozygous or compound heterozygous variants. Rare variants in LRRK2 were nominally associated with PD; six were located between amino acids p.1620 and 1623 in the C-terminal-of-ROC (COR) domain of Lrrk2.

34427960,1,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), frequently referred to as concussion, is one of the most common neurological disorders. The underlying neural mechanisms of functional disturbances in the brains of concussed individuals remain elusive. Novel forms of brain imaging have been developed to assess patients postconcussion, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), diffusion MRI (dMRI), and perfusion MRI [arterial spin labeling (ASL)], but results have been mixed with a more common utilization in the research environment and a slower integration into the clinical setting. In this review, the benefits and drawbacks of the methods are described: fMRI is an effective method in the diagnosis of concussion but it is expensive and time-consuming making it difficult for regular use in everyday practice; SWI allows detection of microhemorrhages in acute and chronic phases of concussion; dMRI is primarily used for the detection of white matter abnormalities, especially axonal injury, specific for mTBI; and ASL is an alternative to the BOLD method with its ability to track cerebral blood flow alterations. Thus, the absence of a universal diagnostic neuroimaging method suggests a need for the adoption of a multimodal approach to the neuroimaging of mTBI. Taken together, these methods, with their underlying functional and structural features, can contribute from different angles to a deeper understanding of mTBI mechanisms such that a comprehensive diagnosis of mTBI becomes feasible for the clinician.",NA,NA,NA
34429053,1,"GABA, the key inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult forebrain, activates pre- and postsynaptic receptors that have been categorized as GABAA, which directly open ligand-gated (or receptor-operated) ion-channels, and GABAB, which are metabotropic since they operate through second messengers. Over the last three decades, several studies have addressed the role of GABAB receptors in the pathophysiology of generalized and focal epileptic disorders. Here, we will address their involvement in focal epileptic disorders by mainly reviewing in vitro studies that have shown: (i) how either enhancing or decreasing GABAB receptor function can favour epileptiform synchronization and thus ictogenesis, although with different features; (ii) the surprising ability of GABAB receptor antagonism to disclose ictal-like activity when the excitatory ionotropic transmission is abolished; and (iii) their contribution to controlling seizure-like discharges during repetitive electrical stimuli delivered in limbic structures. In spite of this evidence, the role of GABAB receptor function in focal epileptic disorders has been attracting less interest when compared to the numerous studies that have addressed GABAA receptor signaling. Therefore, the main aim of our mini-review is to revive interest in the function of GABAB receptors in focal epilepsy research.",NA,NA,NA
34429437,1,"Standard templates are widely used in human neuroimaging processing pipelines to facilitate group-level analyses and comparisons across subjects/populations. MNI-ICBM152 template is the most commonly used standard template, representing an average of 152 healthy young adult brains.

Such differences might inevitably lead to registration errors or subtle biases in downstream analyses and results. Disease-specific templates are therefore desirable to reflect the anatomical characteristics of the populations of interest and reduce potential registration errors.

34437936,1,"Fundamental work on the mechanisms leading to focal epileptic discharges in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) often rests on the use of rodent models in which an initial status epilepticus (SE) is induced by kainic acid or pilocarpine.

Up to a decade ago, rats were most often employed and they were frequently analysed only behaviorally. However, the use of transgenic mice has revealed novel information regarding this animal model. Here, we review recent findings showing the existence of specific neuronal events during both latent and chronic states, and how optogenetic activation of specific cell populations modulate spontaneous seizures.

34442399,1,"The return of genetic results (RoR) to participants, enrolled as children, in autism research remains a complex process. Existing recommendations offer limited guidance on the use of genetic research results for clinical care. We highlight current challenges with RoR and illustrate how the use of a guiding framework drawn from existing literature facilitates RoR and the clinical integration of genetic research results. We report a case series (n = 16) involving the return of genetic results to participants in large genomics studies in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). We outline the framework that guided RoR and facilitated integration into clinical care pathways. We highlight specific cases to illustrate challenges that were, or could have been, resolved through this framework. The case series demonstrates the ethical, clinical and practical difficulties of RoR in ASD genomic studies for participants enrolled as children. Challenges were resolved using pre-established framework to guide RoR and incorporate research genetic results into clinical care. We suggest that optimal use of genetic research results relies on their integration into individualized care pathways for participants.

34446829,1,"This review addresses functional interactions between the primate prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the amygdala, with emphasis on their contributions to behavior and cognition. The interplay between these two telencephalic structures contributes to adaptive behavior and to the evolutionary success of all primate species. In our species, dysfunction in this circuitry creates vulnerabilities to psychopathologies. Here, we describe amygdala-PFC contributions to behaviors that have direct relevance to Darwinian fitness: learned approach and avoidance, foraging, predator defense, and social signaling, which have in common the need for flexibility and sensitivity to specific and rapidly changing contexts. Examples include the prediction of positive outcomes, such as food availability, food desirability, and various social rewards, or of negative outcomes, such as threats of harm from predators or conspecifics. To promote fitness optimally, these stimulus-outcome associations need to be rapidly updated when an associative contingency changes or when the value of a predicted outcome changes. We review evidence from nonhuman primates implicating the PFC, the amygdala, and their functional interactions in these processes, with links to experimental work and clinical findings in humans where possible.",NA,NA,NA
34446931,1,"Compelling experimental evidence suggests that microglial activation is involved in the spread of tau tangles over the neocortex in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We tested the hypothesis that the spatial propagation of microglial activation and tau accumulation colocalize in a Braak-like pattern in the living human brain. We studied 130 individuals across the aging and AD clinical spectrum with positron emission tomography brain imaging for microglial activation ([11C]PBR28), amyloid-β (Aβ) ([18F]AZD4694) and tau ([18F]MK-6240) pathologies. We further assessed microglial triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations and brain gene expression patterns. We found that [11C]PBR28 correlated with CSF soluble TREM2 and showed regional distribution resembling TREM2 gene expression. Network analysis revealed that microglial activation and tau correlated hierarchically with each other following Braak-like stages. Regression analysis revealed that the longitudinal tau propagation pathways depended on the baseline microglia network rather than the tau network circuits. The co-occurrence of Aβ, tau and microglia abnormalities was the strongest predictor of cognitive impairment in our study population. Our findings support a model where an interaction between Aβ and activated microglia sets the pace for tau spread across Braak stages.",NA,NA,NA

34462992,1,Fluorine-18-fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol([18 F]-FEOBV) is a PET radiotracer previously used in neurodegenerative diseases to quantify brain cholinergic denervation.

34463411,1,"Stimulant drug-paired cues can acquire the ability to activate mesocorticolimbic pathways and lead to new bouts of drug use. Studies in laboratory animals suggest that these effects are augmented by progressively greater drug use histories, impulsive personality traits, and acute drug ingestion. As a preliminary test of these hypotheses in humans, we exposed cocaine users (n = 14) and healthy volunteers (n = 10) to cocaine-related videos during two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions, once following acute administration of placebo and once following d-amphetamine (0.3 mg/kg, p.o.). Across sessions, cocaine users showed larger cocaine cue-induced responses than healthy controls in the associative striatum and midbrain. Among the cocaine users, larger drug cue-induced responses during the placebo session were correlated with higher Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) nonplanning scores (associative striatum) and greater lifetime use of stimulant drugs (limbic, associative, and sensorimotor striatum). The administration of d-amphetamine did not augment the cue-induced activations, but, in cocaine users, drug cue-induced striatal activations were more widespread following prolonged cocaine cue exposure. Together, these effects of past and present drug use might aggravate the risk for stimulant drug use problems.",NA,NA,NA

Images were deemed to be MRI negative in 42% of cases on the basis of neuroradiologic reading (40% based on hippocampal volumetry). The predictive model automatically labeled patients as having left or right TLE. Lateralization accuracy was compared to electroclinical data, including side of surgery.

34475828,1,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is characterized by neuronal degeneration and cerebrovascular dysfunction. Increasing evidence indicates that cerebrovascular dysfunction may be a key or an aggravating pathogenic factor in AD. This emphasizes the importance to investigate the tight coupling between neuronal activity and cerebral blood flow (CBF) termed neurovascular coupling (NVC). NVC depends on all cell types of the neurovascular unit within which astrocytes are important players in the progression of AD. Hence, the objective of this study was to characterize the hippocampal NVC in a mouse model of AD. Hippocampal NVC was studied in 6-month-old amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice and their corresponding wild-type littermates using in vivo laser Doppler flowmetry to measure CBF in area CA1 of the hippocampus in response to Schaffer collaterals stimulation. Ex vivo two-photon microscopy experiments were performed to determine astrocytic Ca2+ and vascular responses to electrical field stimulation (EFS) or caged Ca2+ photolysis in hippocampal slices. Neuronal synaptic transmission, astrocytic endfeet Ca2+ in correlation with reactive oxygen species (ROS), and vascular reactivity in the presence or absence of Tempol, a mimetic of superoxide dismutase, were further investigated using electrophysiological, caged Ca2+ photolysis or pharmacological approaches. Whisker stimulation evoked-CBF increases and ex vivo vascular responses to EFS were impaired in APP mice compared with their age-matched controls. APP mice were also characterized by decreased basal synaptic transmission, a shorter astrocytic Ca2+ increase, and altered vascular response to elevated perivascular K+. However, long-term potentiation, astrocytic Ca2+ amplitude in response to EFS, together with vascular responses to nitric oxide remained unchanged. Importantly, we found a significantly increased Ca2+ uncaging-induced ROS production in APP mice. Tempol prevented the vascular response impairment while normalizing astrocytic Ca2+ in APP mice. These findings suggest that NVC is altered at many levels in APP mice, at least in part through oxidative stress. This points out that therapies against AD should include an antioxidative component to protect the neurovascular unit.",NA,NA,NA

34478823,1,"Signaling in brain networks unfolds over multiple topological scales. Areas may exchange information over local circuits, encompassing direct neighbours and areas with similar functions, or over global circuits, encompassing distant neighbours with dissimilar functions. Here we study how the organization of cortico-cortical networks mediate localized and global communication by parametrically tuning the range at which signals are transmitted on the white matter connectome. We show that brain regions vary in their preferred communication scale. By investigating the propensity for brain areas to communicate with their neighbors across multiple scales, we naturally reveal their functional diversity: unimodal regions show preference for local communication and multimodal regions show preferences for global communication. We show that these preferences manifest as region- and scale-specific structure-function coupling. Namely, the functional connectivity of unimodal regions emerges from monosynaptic communication in small-scale circuits, while the functional connectivity of transmodal regions emerges from polysynaptic communication in large-scale circuits. Altogether, the present findings reveal that communication preferences are highly heterogeneous across the cortex, shaping regional differences in structure-function coupling.",NA,NA,NA
34480885,1,"Dyskinesia and psychosis are complications encountered in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) following long-term therapy with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA). Disturbances in the glutamatergic system have been associated with both dyskinesia and psychosis, making glutamatergic modulation a potential therapeutic approach for these. Treatments thus far have sought to dampen glutamatergic transmission, for example through blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors or modulation of metabotropic glutamate receptors 5. In contrast, activation of the glycine-binding site on NMDA receptors is required for their physiological response. Here, we investigated whether indirectly enhancing glutamatergic transmission through inhibition of glycine re-uptake would be efficacious in diminishing both dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs) in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned common marmoset. Six marmosets were rendered parkinsonian by MPTP injection. Following repeated administration of L-DOPA to induce dyskinesia and PLBs, they underwent acute challenges of the glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) inhibitor ALX-5407 (0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg) or vehicle, in combination with L-DOPA, after which the severity of dyskinesia, PLBs and parkinsonian disability was evaluated. In combination with L-DOPA, ALX-5407 0.1 and 1 mg/kg significantly reduced the severity of dyskinesia, by 51% and 41% (both P < 0.001), when compared to vehicle. ALX-5407 0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg also decreased the severity of global PLBs, by 25%, 51% and 38% (all P < 0.001), when compared to vehicle. The benefits on dyskinesia and PLBs were achieved without compromising the therapeutic effect of L-DOPA on parkinsonism. Our results suggest that GlyT1 inhibition may be a novel strategy to attenuate dyskinesia and PLBs in PD, without interfering with L-DOPA anti-parkinsonian action.",NA,NA,NA
34482746,1,"The perspective of autistic individuals is often left uncaptured, and as a result they are often excluded from making decisions that impact them. Conventional communication can be challenging for many autistic individuals, especially those who are minimally verbal or who have an associated intellectual disability. Currently, a lack of appropriate methods to capture voices across the spectrum is a barrier. In the present study, we developed the Autism Voices protocol using universal design principles to capture the perspectives and experiences of autistic youth with a range of language or intellectual abilities. This protocol was then used with 33 autistic youth aged 11 to 18 years. A scoring rubric was developed to capture the unconventional communication used by the participants and the mitigation strategies used by interviewers to facilitate the interview. Many components of the protocol were found to effectively facilitate communication between the participant and interviewer, including the use of picture cards to support verbal questions/prompts, the fact that participants could respond with their preferred communication methods (writing, texting, pointing), and the fact that interviews were applied flexibly to adapt to each participant. Unconventional communication and mitigation strategies were mostly observed in interviews with minimally verbal individuals, but a fine-grained analysis showed participants were still communicating something through this unconventional communication. Our protocol could help promote the inclusion of more autistic individuals in research and showed that unconventional modes of communication like echolalia provide an understanding that participants' are invested in conversations and certain topics are more meaningful than others.",LAY ABSTRACT,NA,NA
34489757,1,"A notable characteristic of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is co-occurring deficits in low-level sensory processing and high-order social interaction. While there is evidence indicating detrimental cascading effects of sensory anomalies on the high-order cognitive functions in ASD, the exact pathological mechanism underlying their atypical functional interaction across the cortical hierarchy has not been systematically investigated. To address this gap, here we assessed the functional organisation of sensory and motor areas in ASD, and their relationship with subcortical and high-order trandmodal systems. In a resting-state fMRI data of 107 ASD and 113 neurotypical individuals, we applied advanced connectopic mapping to probe functional organization of primary sensory/motor areas, together with targeted seed-based intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) analyses. In ASD, the connectopic mapping revealed topological anomalies (i.e., excessively more segregated iFC) in the motor and visual areas, the former of which patterns showed association with the symptom severity of restricted and repetitive behaviors. Moreover, the seed-based analysis found diverging patterns of ASD-related connectopathies: decreased iFCs within the sensory/motor areas but increased iFCs between sensory and subcortical structures. While decreased iFCs were also found within the higher-order functional systems, the overall proportion of this anomaly tends to increase along the level of cortical hierarchy, suggesting more dysconnectivity in the higher-order functional networks. Finally, we demonstrated that the association between low-level sensory/motor iFCs and clinical symptoms in ASD was mediated by the high-order transmodal systems, suggesting pathogenic functional interactions along the cortical hierarchy. Findings were largely replicated in the independent dataset. These results highlight that atypical integration of sensory-to-high-order systems contributes to the complex ASD symptomatology.",NA,NA,NA

34492099,1,"Glomeruli are neuropil-rich regions of the main or accessory olfactory bulbs (AOB) where the axons of olfactory or vomeronasal neurons and dendrites of mitral/tufted cells form synaptic connections. In the main olfactory system, olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) expressing the same receptor innervate 1 or 2 glomeruli. However, in the accessory olfactory system, vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) expressing the same receptor can innervate up to 30 different glomeruli in the AOB. Genetic mutation disrupting genes with a role in defining the identity/diversity of olfactory and vomeronasal neurons can alter the number and size of glomeruli. Interestingly, 2 cell surface molecules, Kirrel2 and Kirrel3, have been indicated as playing a critical role in the organization of axons into glomeruli in the AOB. Being able to quantify differences in glomeruli features, such as number, size, or immunoreactivity for specific markers, is an important experimental approach to validate the role of specific genes in controlling neuronal connectivity and circuit formation in either control or mutant animals. Since the manual recognition and quantification of glomeruli on digital images is a challenging and time-consuming task, we generated a program in Python able to identify glomeruli in digital images and quantify their properties, such as size, number, and pixel intensity. Validation of our program indicates that our script is a fast and suitable tool for high-throughput quantification of glomerular features of mouse lines with different genetic makeup.",NA,NA,NA

34497278,1,"Bipolar affective disorder (BD) is a severe psychiatric illness, for which lithium (Li) is the gold standard for acute and maintenance therapies. The therapeutic response to Li in BD is heterogeneous and reliable biomarkers allowing patients stratification are still needed. A GWAS performed by the International Consortium on Lithium Genetics (ConLiGen) has recently identified genetic markers associated with treatment responses to Li in the human leukocyte antigens (HLA) region. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this association, we have genetically imputed the classical alleles of the HLA region in the European patients of the ConLiGen cohort. We found our best signal for amino-acid variants belonging to the HLA-DRB1*11:01 classical allele, associated with a better response to Li (p < 1 × 10-3; FDR < 0.09 in the recessive model). Alanine or Leucine at position 74 of the HLA-DRB1 heavy chain was associated with a good response while Arginine or Glutamic acid with a poor response. As these variants have been implicated in common inflammatory/autoimmune processes, our findings strongly suggest that HLA-mediated low inflammatory background may contribute to the efficient response to Li in BD patients, while an inflammatory status overriding Li anti-inflammatory properties would favor a weak response.",NA,NA,NA
34500068,1,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) represents a complex neurodegenerative disorder with significant genetic heterogeneity. To date, both the genetic etiology and the underlying molecular mechanisms driving this disease remain poorly understood, although in recent years several studies have highlighted a number of genetic mutations causative for ALS. With these mutations pointing to potential pathways that may be affected within individuals with ALS, having the ability to generate human neurons and other disease relevant cells containing these mutations becomes even more critical if new therapies are to emerge. Recent developments with the advent of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) gene editing fields gave us the tools to introduce or correct a specific mutation at any site within the genome of an iPSC, and thus model the specific contribution of risk mutations. In this study we describe a rapid and efficient way to either introduce a mutation into a control line, or to correct an allele-specific mutation, generating an isogenic control line from patient-derived iPSCs with a given mutation. The mutations introduced were the G94A (also known as G93A) mutation into SOD1 or H517Q into FUS, and the mutation corrected was a patient iPSC line with I114T mutation in SOD1. A combination of small molecules and growth factors were used to guide a stepwise differentiation of the edited cells into motor neurons in order to demonstrate that disease-relevant cells could be generated for downstream applications. Through a combination of iPSCs and CRISPR editing, the cells generated here will provide fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying neuron degeneration in ALS.",NA,NA,NA
34503967,1,"Spontaneous recognition memory tasks are widely used to assess cognitive function in rodents and have become commonplace in the characterization of rodent models of neurodegenerative, neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Leveraging an animal's innate preference for novelty, these tasks use object exploration to capture the what, where and when components of recognition memory. Choosing and optimizing objects is a key feature when designing recognition memory tasks. Although the range of objects used in these tasks varies extensively across studies, object features can bias exploration, influence task difficulty and alter brain circuit recruitment. Here, we discuss the advantages of using 3D-printed objects in rodent spontaneous recognition memory tasks. We provide strategies for optimizing their design and usage, and offer a repository of tested, open-source designs for use with commonly used rodent species. The easy accessibility, low-cost, renewability and flexibility of 3D-printed open-source designs make this approach an important step toward improving rigor and reproducibility in rodent spontaneous recognition memory tasks.",NA,NA,NA

34510134,1,"The innate motivation to avoid pain can be disrupted when individuals experience uncontrollable stress, such as pain. This can lead to maladaptive behaviors, including passivity, and negative affect. Despite its importance, motivational aspects of pain avoidance are understudied in humans and their neural mechanisms vastly unknown. Rodent models suggest an important role of the periaqueductal gray, but it is unknown whether it subserves a similar role in humans. Furthermore, it is unclear whether pain avoidance is associated with individual differences in pain coping. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, networks underlying pain avoidance behavior were examined in 32 participants with and without episodic migraine. Pain avoidance behavior was assessed using an adaptation of the incentive delay task. In each trial of the task, participants tried to avoid a painful stimulus and receive a nonpainful one instead while the difficulty to succeed varied across trials (3 difficulty levels: safe, easy, and difficult). After unsuccessful pain avoidance on the preceding trial, participants showed reduced pain avoidance behavior, especially in the difficult condition. This reduction in behavior was associated with higher helplessness scores only in participants with migraine. Higher helplessness in participants with migraine was further correlated with a stronger decrease in activation of cortical areas associated with motor behavior, attention, and memory after unsuccessful pain avoidance. Of these areas, specifically posterior parietal cortex activation predicted individual's pain avoidance behavior on the next trial. The results link individual pain coping capacity to patterns of neural activation associated with altered pain avoidance in patients with migraine.",ABSTRACT,NA,NA
34510282,1,"Decomposition of whole-brain functional connectivity patterns reveals a principal gradient that captures the separation of sensorimotor cortex from heteromodal regions in the default mode network (DMN). Functional homotopy is strongest in sensorimotor areas, and weakest in heteromodal cortices, suggesting there may be differences between the left and right hemispheres (LH/RH) in the principal gradient, especially towards its apex. This study characterised hemispheric differences in the position of large-scale cortical networks along the principal gradient, and their functional significance. We collected resting-state fMRI and semantic, working memory and non-verbal reasoning performance in 175 + healthy volunteers. We then extracted the principal gradient of connectivity for each participant, tested which networks showed significant hemispheric differences on the gradient, and regressed participants' behavioural efficiency in tasks outside the scanner against interhemispheric gradient differences for each network. LH showed a higher overall principal gradient value, consistent with its role in heteromodal semantic cognition. One frontotemporal control subnetwork was linked to individual differences in semantic cognition: when it was nearer heteromodal DMN on the principal gradient in LH, participants showed more efficient semantic retrieval-and this network also showed a strong hemispheric difference in response to semantic demands but not working memory load in a separate study. In contrast, when a dorsal attention subnetwork was closer to the heteromodal end of the principal gradient in RH, participants showed better visual reasoning. Lateralization of function may reflect differences in connectivity between control and heteromodal regions in LH, and attention and visual regions in RH.",NA,NA,NA
34512503,1,"Background: Cognitive impairment is one of the most prominent non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), due in part to known cerebellar dysfunctions. Furthermore, previous studies have reported altered cerebellar functional connectivity (FC) in PD patients. Yet whether these changes are also due to the cognitive deficits in PD remain unclear. Methods: A total of 122 non-dementia participants, including 64 patients with early PD and 58 age- and gender-matched elderly controls were stratified into four groups based on their cognitive status (normal cognition vs. cognitive impairment). Cerebellar volumetry and FC were investigated by analyzing, respectively, structural and resting-state functional MRI data among groups using quality control and quantitative measures. Correlation analysis between MRI metrics and clinical features (motor and cognitive scores) were performed. Results: Compared to healthy control subjects with no cognitive deficits, altered cerebellar FC were observed in early PD participants with both motor and cognitive deficits, but not in PD patients with normal cognition, nor elderly subjects showing signs of a cognitive impairment. Moreover, connectivity between the ""motor"" cerebellum and SMA was positively correlated with motor scores, while intracerebellar connectivity was positively correlated with cognitive scores in PD patients with cognitive impairment. No cerebellar volumetric difference was observed between groups. Conclusions: These findings show that altered cerebellar FC during resting state in early PD patients may be driven not solely by the motor deficits, but by cognitive deficits as well, hence highlighting the interplay between motor and cognitive functioning, and possibly reflecting compensatory mechanisms, in the early PD.",NA,NA,NA
34515549,1,"A vascular insult occurring early in disease onset may initiate cognitive decline leading to dementia, while pharmacological and lifestyle interventions can prevent this progression. Mice with a selective, tamoxifen-inducible deletion of NF-κB essential modulator (Nemo) in brain endothelial cells were studied as a model of vascular cognitive impairment. Groups included NemoFl controls and three NemobeKO groups: One untreated, and two treated with simvastatin or exercise. Social preference and nesting were impaired in NemobeKO mice and were not countered by treatments. Cerebrovascular function was compromised in NemobeKO groups regardless of treatment, with decreased changes in sensory-evoked cerebral blood flow and total hemoglobin levels, and impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation. NemobeKO mice had increased string vessel pathology, blood-brain barrier disruption, neuroinflammation, and reduced cortical somatostatin-containing interneurons. These alterations were reversed when endothelial function was recovered. Findings strongly suggest that damage to the cerebral endothelium can trigger pathologies associated with dementia and its functional integrity should be an effective target in future therapeutic efforts.",NA,NA,NA
34515754,1,"Tracking longitudinal tau tangles accumulation across the Alzheimer's disease continuum is crucial to better understand the natural history of tau pathology and for clinical trials. Although the available first-generation tau PET tracers detect tau accumulation in symptomatic individuals, their nanomolar affinity offers limited sensitivity to detect early tau accumulation in asymptomatic subjects. Here, we hypothesized the novel subnanomolar affinity tau tangles tracer 18F-MK-6240 can detect longitudinal tau accumulation in asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects. We studied 125 living individuals (65 cognitively unimpaired elderly amyloid-β-negative, 22 cognitively unimpaired elderly amyloid-β-positive, 21 mild cognitive impairment amyloid-β-positive and 17 Alzheimer's disease dementia amyloid-β-positive individuals) with baseline amyloid-β 18F-AZD4694 PET and baseline and follow-up tau 18F-MK-6240 PET. The 18F-MK-6240 standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was calculated at 90-110 min after tracer injection and the cerebellar crus I was used as the reference region. In addition, we assessed the in vivo18F-MK-6240 SUVR and post-mortem phosphorylated tau pathology in two participants with Alzheimer's disease dementia who died after the PET scans. We found that the cognitively unimpaired amyloid-β-negative individuals had significant longitudinal tau accumulation confined to the PET Braak-like stage I (3.9%) and II (2.8%) areas. The cognitively unimpaired amyloid-β-positive individuals showed greater tau accumulation in Braak-like stage I (8.9%) compared with later Braak stages. The patients with mild cognitive impairment and those who were Alzheimer's dementia amyloid-β-positive exhibited tau accumulation in Braak regions III-VI but not I-II. Cognitively impaired amyloid-β-positive individuals that were Braak II-IV at baseline displayed a 4.6-7.5% annual increase in tau accumulation in the Braak III-IV regions, whereas those who were cognitively impaired amyloid-β-positive Braak V-VI at baseline showed an 8.3-10.7% annual increase in the Braak regions V-VI. Neuropathological assessments confirmed PET-based Braak stages V-VI in the two brain donors. Our results suggest that the 18F-MK-6240 SUVR is able to detect longitudinal tau accumulation in asymptomatic and symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. The highest magnitude of 18F-MK-6240 SUVR accumulation moved from the medial temporal to sensorimotor cortex across the disease clinical spectrum. Trials using the 18F-MK-6240 SUVR in cognitively unimpaired individuals would be required to use regions of interest corresponding to early Braak stages, whereas trials in cognitively impaired subjects would benefit from using regions of interest associated with late Braak stages. Anti-tau trials should take into consideration an individual's baseline PET Braak-like stage to minimize the variability introduced by the hierarchical accumulation of tau tangles in the human brain. Finally, our post-mortem findings supported use of the 18F-MK-6240 SUVR as a biomarker to stage tau pathology in patients with Alzheimer's disease.",NA,NA,NA

Images were initially deemed MRI-negative in 51% of patients, in whom intracranial EEG determined the focus. For risk stratification, the CNN incorporated bayesian uncertainty estimation as a measure of confidence. To evaluate performance, detection maps were compared to expert FCD manual labels.

34526291,1,"The ILAE Neuroimaging Task Force aims to publish educational case reports highlighting basic aspects related to neuroimaging in epilepsy consistent with the educational mission of the ILAE. Previous quantitative MRI studies have established important imaging markers of epilepsy-related pathology, including features sensitive to hippocampal cell loss and reactive astrogliosis. Here, we review the case of a female with pediatric drug-resistant epilepsy. Throughout her course of treatment, she had seven MRI investigations at several centers; the first three did not follow optimized epilepsy imaging protocols whereas the remaining four adhered to HARNESS-MRI protocols ( har monized n euroimaging of e pilepsy s tructural s equences). Visual inspection of a set of HARNESS-MR images revealed conspicuous left hippocampal hyperintensity which may have been initially overlooked on non-optimized MR images. Quantitative analysis of these multimodal imaging data along hippocampal subfields provided clear evidence of hippocampal sclerosis, with increased atrophy, increased mean diffusivity, increased T2-FLAIR signal, and lower qT1 values observed in the anterior portions of the left, compared to the right hippocampus. The patient underwent a left anterior temporal lobectomy with amygdalohippocampectomy at age 16 years. Histopathology of the resected specimen also confirmed hippocampal sclerosis with widespread gliosis and focal neuronal loss in the hippocampal subfields overlapping with regions of multimodal quantitative alterations. The patient remains seizure-free one year after surgery. Collectively, this case highlights the need for optimized data acquisition protocols early in the treatment of epilepsy and supports quantitative analysis of MRI contrasts to enhance personalized diagnosis and prognosis of drug-resistant patients with epilepsy.",NA,NA,NA
34530877,1,"Vacuolar protein sorting 35 (VPS35) regulates neurotransmitter receptor recycling from endosomes. A missense mutation (D620N) in VPS35 leads to autosomal-dominant, late-onset Parkinson's disease. Here, we study the basic neurobiology of VPS35 and Parkinson's disease mutation effects in the D620N knock-in mouse and the effect of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) inhibition on synaptic phenotypes. The study was conducted using a VPS35 D620N knock-in mouse that expresses VPS35 at endogenous levels. Protein levels, phosphorylation states, and binding ratios in brain lysates from knock-in mice and wild-type littermates were assayed by co-immunoprecipitation and western blot. Dendritic protein co-localization, AMPA receptor surface expression, synapse density, and glutamatergic synapse activity in primary cortical cultures from knock-in and wild-type littermates were assayed using immunocytochemistry and whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology. In brain tissue, we confirm VPS35 forms complexes with LRRK2 and AMPA-type glutamate receptor GluA1 subunits, in addition to NMDA-type glutamate receptor GluN1 subunits and D2-type dopamine receptors. Receptor and LRRK2 binding was unaltered in D620N knock-in mice, but we confirm the mutation results in reduced binding of VPS35 with WASH complex member FAM21, and increases phosphorylation of the LRRK2 kinase substrate Rab10, which is reversed by LRRK2 kinase inhibition in vivo. In cultured cortical neurons from knock-in mice, pRab10 is also increased, and reversed by LRRK2 inhibition. The mutation also results in increased endosomal recycling protein cluster density (VPS35-FAM21 co-clusters and Rab11 clusters), glutamate transmission, and GluA1 surface expression. LRRK2 kinase inhibition, which reversed Rab10 hyper-phosphorylation, did not rescue elevated glutamate release or surface GluA1 expression in knock-in neurons, but did alter AMPAR traffic in wild-type cells. The results improve our understanding of the cell biology of VPS35, and the consequences of the D620N mutation in developing neuronal networks. Together the data support a chronic synaptopathy model for latent neurodegeneration, providing phenotypes and candidate pathophysiological stresses that may drive eventual transition to late-stage parkinsonism in VPS35 PD. The study demonstrates the VPS35 mutation has effects that are independent of ongoing LRRK2 kinase activity, and that LRRK2 kinase inhibition alters basal physiology of glutamate synapses in vitro.",NA,NA,NA
34535640,1,"Axonal degeneration is a common feature of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, yet the mechanisms underlying its various manifestations are incompletely understood. We previously demonstrated that axonal degeneration is associated with externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS), which precedes morphological evidence of degeneration, is redox-sensitive, and is delayed in Wallerian degeneration slow (WldS) mutant animals. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is the other major membrane phospholipid in the inner leaflet of the cell membrane, and given that PS signals apoptosis, phagocytosis, and degeneration, we hypothesized that PS and PE membrane dynamics play distinct roles in axonal degeneration. To test this hypothesis, axonal degeneration was induced with calcium ionophores in postnatal rat retinal ganglion cells, and PS- and PE-specific fluorescent probes used to measure their externalization over time. In untreated cells, cell-surface PS was prominent in the cell body alone. Elevation of intracellular calcium with calcium ionophores resulted in significantly increased levels of PS externalization in the cell body, axon, and axon growth cone. Unlike PS, cell-surface PE was diffusely distributed in untreated cells, with comparable levels across the soma, axons, and axon terminals. After exposure to calcium ionophores, PE externalization significantly increased in the cell body and axon. Elevated intracellular calcium also resulted in the formation of axonal blebs which exclusively contained externalized PS, but not PE. Together, these results indicated distinct patterns of externalized PS and PE in normal and degenerating neurons, suggesting a differential role for these phospholipids in transducing neuronal injury.",NA,NA,NA

34548517,1,"An important aspect of managing a limited cognitive resource like attention is to use the reward value of stimuli to prioritize the allocation of attention to higher-value over lower-value stimuli. Recent evidence suggests this depends on dopaminergic signaling of reward. In Parkinson's disease, both reward sensitivity and attention are impaired, but whether these deficits are directly related to one another is unknown. We tested whether Parkinson's patients use reward information when automatically allocating their attention and whether this is modulated by dopamine replacement. We compared patients, tested both ON and OFF dopamine replacement medication, to older controls using a standard attention capture task. First, participants learned the different reward values of stimuli. Then, these reward-associated stimuli were used as distractors in a visual search task. We found that patients were generally distracted by the presence of the distractors but that the degree of distraction caused by the high-value and low-value distractors was similar. Furthermore, we found no evidence to support the possibility that dopamine replacement modulates the effect of reward on automatic attention allocation. Our results suggest a possible inability in Parkinson's patients to use the reward value of stimuli when automatically allocating their attention, and raise the possibility that reward-driven allocation of resources may affect the adaptive modulation of other cognitive processes.",NA,NA,NA

To facilitate the wide-scale adoption of digital health care technology and to align current initiatives, we outline a road map that will identify clinically relevant digital parameters; mediate the development of benefit-to-burden criteria for innovative technology; and direct the validation, harmonization, and adoption of digital health care technology in real-world settings. We define two key end products of the road map: (1) a set of reliable digital parameters to capture data collected under free-living conditions that reflect patient-centric measures and facilitate clinical decision making and (2) an integrated, open-source system that provides personalized feedback to patients, health care providers, clinical researchers, and caregivers and is linked to a flexible and adaptable platform that integrates patient data in real time. Given the ever-changing care needs of patients and the relentless progression rate of motor neuron disease, the adoption of digital health care technology will significantly benefit the delivery of care and accelerate the development of effective treatments.",NA,NA,NA

34552464,1,"The interactions between epilepsy and sleep are numerous and the impact of epilepsy on cognition is well documented. Epilepsy is therefore likely to influence dreaming as one sleep-related cognitive activity. The frequency of dream recall is indeed decreased in patients with epilepsy, especially in those with primary generalized seizures. The content of dreams is also disturbed in epilepsy patients, being more negative and with more familiar settings. While several confounding factors (anti-seizure medications, depression and anxiety disorders, cognitive impairment) may partly account for these changes, some observations suggest an effect of seizures themselves on dreams. Indeed, the incorporation of seizure symptoms in dream content has been described, concomitant or not with a focal epileptic discharge during sleep, suggesting that epilepsy might directly or indirectly interfere with dreaming. These observations, together with current knowledge on dream neurophysiology and the links between epilepsy and sleep, suggest that epilepsy may impact not only wake- but also sleep-related cognition.",NA,NA,NA

We illustrate the imaging characteristics of these exceedingly rare tumors and discuss the role of 4D CTA in confirming this diagnosis and guiding surgical management. Finally, we present a literature review of imaging findings, differential diagnosis, management, and prognosis. Case A 39-year-old woman known for diabetes mellitus type II and dyslipidemia presented with headache, bitemporal hemianopsia, and mild hyperprolactinemia. Initial diagnosis of suprasellar meningioma separate from pituitary gland was revised to definitive diagnosis of suprasellar hemangioblastoma after 4D CTA. Conclusion Suprasellar hemangioblastomas are extremely rare, often associated to VHL disease.

34557154,1,"Despite changes in guideline-based management of moderate/severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) over the preceding decades, little impact on mortality and morbidity have been seen. This argues against the ""one-treatment fits all"" approach to such management strategies. With this, some preliminary advances in the area of personalized medicine in TBI care have displayed promising results. However, to continue transitioning toward individually-tailored care, we require integration of complex ""-omics"" data sets. The past few decades have seen dramatic increases in the volume of complex multi-modal data in moderate and severe TBI care. Such data includes serial high-fidelity multi-modal characterization of the cerebral physiome, serum/cerebrospinal fluid proteomics, admission genetic profiles, and serial advanced neuroimaging modalities. Integrating these complex and serially obtained data sets, with patient baseline demographics, treatment information and clinical outcomes over time, can be a daunting task for the treating clinician. Within this review, we highlight the current status of such multi-modal omics data sets in moderate/severe TBI, current limitations to the utilization of such data, and a potential path forward through employing integrative neuroinformatic approaches, which are applied in other neuropathologies. Such advances are positioned to facilitate the transition to precision prognostication and inform a top-down approach to the development of personalized therapeutics in moderate/severe TBI.",NA,NA,NA
34566556,1,"The infant brain undergoes a remarkable period of neural development that is crucial for the development of cognitive and behavioral capacities (Hasegawa et al., 2018). Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is able to characterize the developmental trajectories and is critical in neuroimaging studies of early brain development. However, missing data at different time points is an unavoidable occurrence in longitudinal studies owing to participant attrition and scan failure. Compared to dropping incomplete data, data imputation is considered a better solution to address such missing data in order to preserve all available samples. In this paper, we adapt generative adversarial networks (GAN) to a new application: longitudinal image prediction of structural MRI in the first year of life. In contrast to existing medical image-to-image translation applications of GANs, where inputs and outputs share a very close anatomical structure, our task is more challenging as brain size, shape and tissue contrast vary significantly between the input data and the predicted data. Several improvements over existing GAN approaches are proposed to address these challenges in our task. To enhance the realism, crispness, and accuracy of the predicted images, we incorporate both a traditional voxel-wise reconstruction loss as well as a perceptual loss term into the adversarial learning scheme. As the differing contrast changes in T1w and T2w MR images in the first year of life, we incorporate multi-contrast images leading to our proposed 3D multi-contrast perceptual adversarial network (MPGAN). Extensive evaluations are performed to assess the qualityand fidelity of the predicted images, including qualitative and quantitative assessments of the image appearance, as well as quantitative assessment on two segmentation tasks. Our experimental results show that our MPGAN is an effective solution for longitudinal MR image data imputation in the infant brain. We further apply our predicted/imputed images to two practical tasks, a regression task and a classification task, in order to highlight the enhanced task-related performance following image imputation. The results show that the model performance in both tasks is improved by including the additional imputed data, demonstrating the usability of the predicted images generated from our approach.",NA,NA,NA

34569363,1,"Objective: To understand current genetic testing practices at Canadian ALS clinics. Methods: An online survey and phone interviews, with clinicians practicing in 27 ALS clinics in Canada, were employed to collect data. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted. Results: Ninety-three percent (25/27) of ALS clinics in Canada are routinely ordering genetic testing for familial ALS, while 33% (9/27) of clinics are routinely ordering genetic testing for sporadic ALS. Barriers to genetic testing include a perceived lack of an impact on treatment plan, difficulty in obtaining approvals, primarily from provincial Ministries of Health, and limited access to genetic counseling. Predictive testing practices were found to be the most variable across the country. The average wait time for a symptomatic patient living with ALS to see a genetic counselor in Canada is 10 months (range 0-36 months). Conclusions: Access to genetic testing, and testing practices, vary greatly across Canadian ALS clinics. There may be patients with a monogenetic etiology to their ALS who are not being identified given that genetic testing for patients diagnosed with ALS is not routinely performed at all clinics. This study highlights potential inequities for patients with ALS that can arise from variability in health care delivery across jurisdictions, in a federally-funded, but provincially-regulated, health care system. Clinical trials for both symptomatic ALS patients and pre-symptomatic ALS gene carriers are ongoing, and ALS clinicians in Canada are motivated to improve access to genetic testing for ALS.",NA,NA,NA

Music perception was examined using the Scale and Rhythm tests of the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia, in association with CT scans to identify lesion laterality. Verbal short-term memory was examined using Digit Span Forward. TBI patients had greater impairment than controls, with 43% demonstrating deficits in pitch perception, and 40% in rhythm perception. Deficits were greater with right hemisphere damage than left. Pitch and rhythm deficits co-occurred 31% of the time, suggesting partly dissociable networks. There was a dissociation between performance on verbal STM and pitch and rhythm perception 39 to 42% of the time (respectively), with most individuals (92%) demonstrating intact verbal STM, with impaired pitch or rhythm perception.

34582484,1,"It is well established that sex differences exist in the manifestation of vascular diseases. Arterial stiffness (AS) has been associated with changes in cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and cognitive decline in aging. Specifically, older adults with increased AS show a decline on executive function (EF) tasks. Interestingly, the relationship between AS and CVR is more complex, where some studies show decreased CVR with increased AS, and others demonstrate preserved CVR despite higher AS. Here, we investigated the possible role of sex on these hemodynamic relationships. Acquisitions were completed in 48 older adults. Pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) data were collected during a hypercapnia challenge. Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) data was acquired using cine phase contrast velocity series. Cognitive function was assessed with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, and a composite score for EF was calculated using four cognitive tests from the neuropsychological battery. A moderation model test revealed that sex moderated the relationship between PWV and CVR and PWV and EF, but not between CVR and EF. Together, our results indicate that the relationships between central stiffness, cerebral hemodynamics and cognition are in part mediated by sex.",NA,NA,NA
34584092,1,"Genetic factors contribute to neurodegenerative diseases, with high heritability estimates across diagnoses; however, a large portion of the genetic influence remains poorly understood. Many previous studies have attempted to fill the gaps by performing linkage analyses and association studies in individual disease cohorts, but have failed to consider the clinical and pathological overlap observed across neurodegenerative diseases and the potential for genetic overlap between the phenotypes. Here, we leveraged rare variant association analyses (RVAAs) to elucidate the genetic overlap among multiple neurodegenerative diagnoses, including Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), mild cognitive impairment, and Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as cerebrovascular disease, using the data generated with a custom-designed neurodegenerative disease gene panel in the Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative (ONDRI). As expected, only ~3% of ONDRI participants harboured a monogenic variant likely driving their disease presentation. Yet, when genes were binned based on previous disease associations, we observed an enrichment of putative loss of function variants in PD genes across all ONDRI cohorts. Further, individual gene-based RVAA identified significant enrichment of rare, nonsynonymous variants in PARK2 in the FTD cohort, and in NOTCH3 in the PD cohort. The results indicate that there may be greater heterogeneity in the genetic factors contributing to neurodegeneration than previously appreciated. Although the mechanisms by which these genes contribute to disease presentation must be further explored, we hypothesize they may be a result of rare variants of moderate phenotypic effect contributing to overlapping pathology and clinical features observed across neurodegenerative diagnoses.",NA,NA,NA

34588439,1,"Large, openly available datasets and current analytic tools promise the emergence of population neuroscience. The considerable diversity in personality traits and behaviour between individuals is reflected in the statistical variability of neural data collected in such repositories. Recent studies with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have concluded that patterns of resting-state functional connectivity can both successfully distinguish individual participants within a cohort and predict some individual traits, yielding the notion of an individual's neural fingerprint. Here, we aim to clarify the neurophysiological foundations of individual differentiation from features of the rich and complex dynamics of resting-state brain activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 158 participants. We show that akin to fMRI approaches, neurophysiological functional connectomes enable the differentiation of individuals, with rates similar to those seen with fMRI. We also show that individual differentiation is equally successful from simpler measures of the spatial distribution of neurophysiological spectral signal power. Our data further indicate that differentiation can be achieved from brain recordings as short as 30 seconds, and that it is robust over time: the neural fingerprint is present in recordings performed weeks after their baseline reference data was collected. This work, thus, extends the notion of a neural or brain fingerprint to fast and large-scale resting-state electrophysiological dynamics.",NA,NA,NA
34593302,1,"MAPT encodes the microtubule-associated protein tau, which is the main component of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and found in other protein aggregates. These aggregates are among the pathological hallmarks of primary tauopathies such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Abnormal tau can also be observed in secondary tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease (PD). On top of pathological findings, genetic data also links MAPT to these disorders. MAPT variations are a cause or risk factors for many tauopathies and synucleinopathies and are associated with certain clinical and pathological features in affected individuals. In addition to clinical, pathological, and genetic overlap, evidence also suggests that tau and alpha-synuclein may interact on the molecular level, and thus might collaborate in the neurodegenerative process. Understanding the role of MAPT variations in tauopathies and synucleinopathies is therefore essential to elucidate the role of tau in the pathogenesis and phenotype of those disorders, and ultimately to develop targeted therapies. In this review, we describe the role of MAPT genetic variations in tauopathies and synucleinopathies, several genotype-phenotype and pathological features, and discuss their implications for the classification and treatment of those disorders.",NA,NA,NA

These are accompanied by changes in cortical networks, as well as attention and reward circuits.

Here, we review evidence for this model, identify determinants and consequences, and survey the challenges and opportunities posed by an exploitation-biased mental mode in later life.",NA,NA,NA
34594193,1,"The temporal trajectories and neural mechanisms of recovery of cognitive function after a major perturbation of consciousness is of both clinical and neuroscientific interest. The purpose of the present study was to investigate network-level changes in functional brain connectivity associated with the recovery and return of six cognitive functions after general anesthesia. High-density electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded from healthy volunteers undergoing a clinically relevant anesthesia protocol (propofol induction and isoflurane maintenance), and age-matched healthy controls. A battery of cognitive tests (motor praxis, visual object learning test, fractal-2-back, abstract matching, psychomotor vigilance test, digital symbol substitution test) was administered at baseline, upon recovery of consciousness (ROC), and at half-hour intervals up to 3 h following ROC. EEG networks were derived using the strength of functional connectivity measured through the weighted phase lag index (wPLI). A partial least squares (PLS) analysis was conducted to assess changes in these networks: (1) between anesthesia and control groups; (2) during the 3-h recovery from anesthesia; and (3) for each cognitive test during recovery from anesthesia. Networks were maximally perturbed upon ROC but returned to baseline 30-60 min following ROC, despite deficits in cognitive performance that persisted up to 3 h following ROC. Additionally, during recovery from anesthesia, cognitive tests conducted at the same time-point activated distinct and dissociable functional connectivity networks across all frequency bands. The results highlight that the return of cognitive function after anesthetic-induced unconsciousness is task-specific, with unique behavioral and brain network trajectories of recovery.",NA,NA,NA
34599206,1,"Differential expression of cell adhesion molecules in neuronal populations is one of the many mechanisms promoting the formation of functional neural circuits in the developing nervous system.

However, there is still limited and fragmented information about their patterns of expression in certain regions of the developing nervous system and how their expression contributes to their function. Utilizing an in situ hybridization approach, we have analyzed the spatiotemporal expression of all IgLON family members in the developing mouse brain, spinal cord, eye, olfactory epithelium, and vomeronasal organ. At one prenatal (E16) and two postnatal (P0 and P15) ages, we show that each IgLON displays distinct expression patterns in the olfactory system, cerebral cortex, midbrain, cerebellum, spinal cord, and eye, indicating that they likely contribute to the wiring of specific neuronal circuitry.

In turn, myelination may be altered by changes in experience, neuronal activity, and vesicular release, but the links between sensory experience, corresponding neuronal activity, and resulting alterations in myelination require further investigation. We thus studied the development of myelination in the Xenopus laevis tadpole, a classic model for studies of visual system development and function because it is translucent and visually responsive throughout the formation of its retinotectal system. We begin with a systematic characterization of the timecourse of early myelin ensheathment in the Xenopus retinotectal system using immunohistochemistry of myelin basic protein (MBP) along with third harmonic generation (THG) microscopy, a label-free structural imaging technique. Based on the mid-larval developmental progression of MBP expression in Xenopus, we identified an appropriate developmental window in which to assess the effects of early temporally patterned visual experience on myelin ensheathment. We used calcium imaging of axon terminals in vivo to characterize the responses of retinal ganglion cells over a range of stroboscopic stimulation frequencies. Strobe frequencies that reliably elicited robust versus dampened calcium responses were then presented to animals for 7 d, and differences in the amount of early myelin ensheathment at the optic chiasm were subsequently quantified. This study provides evidence that it is not just the presence but also to the specific temporal properties of sensory stimuli that are important for myelin plasticity.",NA,NA,NA

34602979,1,"Astrocytes are a large group of glial cells that perform a variety of physiological functions in the nervous system. They provide trophic, as well as structural, support to neuronal cells. Astrocytes are also involved in neuroinflammatory processes contributing to neuronal dysfunction and death.

Understanding these mechanisms necessitates the combined use of animal and human cell-based experimental model systems, at least in part because human astrocytes display a number of unique features that cannot be recapitulated in animal models. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based approaches provide the opportunity to generate disease-relevant human astrocytes to investigate the roles of these cells in ALS. These approaches are facing the growing recognition that there are heterogenous populations of astrocytes in the nervous system which are not functionally equivalent.

Each participant listened to both English and French utterances, providing segmentation patterns that included both their native language (used as reference) and their L2. Interestingly, different patterns of results were observed in the event-related potentials (online) and behavioral (offline) results, suggesting that L2 participants showed signs of being able to adapt their segmentation strategies to the specifics of the L2 (online ERP results), but that the extent of the adaptation varied as a function of listeners' language experience (offline behavioral results).",NA,NA,NA

Ca2+ transients occur spontaneously in radial astrocytes at rest and are abolished by silencing neuronal activity with tetrodotoxin. Visual stimulation drives temporally correlated increases in the activity patterns of neighboring radial astrocytes. Following blockade of all glutamate receptors (gluRs), visually evoked Ca2+ activity in radial astrocytes persists, while neuronal activity is suppressed. The additional blockade of either glu transporters or sodium-calcium exchangers (NCX) abolishes visually evoked responses in glia. Finally, we demonstrate that blockade of NCX alone is sufficient to prevent visually evoked responses in radial astrocytes, highlighting a pivotal role for NCX in glia during development.",NA,NA,NA

34625707,1,"Commonly comorbid early onset psychiatric disorders might reflect the varying expression of overlapping risk factors. The mediating processes remain poorly understood, but three factors show some promise: adolescent externalizing traits, early life adversity, and midbrain dopamine autoreceptors. To investigate whether these features acquire greater predictive power when combined, a longitudinal study was conducted in youth who have been followed since birth. Cohort members were invited to participate based on externalizing scores between 11 to 16 years of age. At age 18 (age 18.5 ± 0.6 y.o.), 52 entry criteria meeting volunteers had a 90-min positron emission tomography scan with [18F]fallypride, completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5. The three-factor model identified those with a lifetime history of DSM-5 disorders with an overall accuracy of 90.4% (p = 2.4 × 10-5) and explained 91.5% of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [95% CI: .824, 1.000]. Targeting externalizing disorders specifically did not yield a more powerful model than targeting all disorders (p = 0.54). The model remained significant when including data from participants who developed their first disorders during a three-year follow-up period (p = 3.5 × 10-5). Together, these results raise the possibility that a combination of temperamental traits, childhood adversity, and poorly regulated dopamine transmission increases risk for diverse, commonly comorbid, early onset psychiatric problems, predicting this susceptibility prospectively.",NA,NA,NA
34626666,1,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is defined as a complex disorder with multifactorial pathogenesis, yet a more accurate definition could be that PD is not a single entity, but rather a mixture of different diseases with similar phenotypes. Attempts to classify subtypes of PD have been made based on clinical phenotypes or biomarkers. However, the most practical approach, at least for a portion of the patients, could be to classify patients based on genes involved in PD. GBA and LRRK2 mutations are the most common genetic causes or risk factors of PD, and PRKN is the most common cause of autosomal recessive form of PD. Patients carrying variants in GBA, LRRK2 or PRKN differ in some of their clinical characteristics, pathology and biochemical parameters. Thus, these three PD-associated genes are of special interest for drug development. Existing therapeutic approaches in PD are strictly symptomatic, as numerous clinical trials aimed at modifying PD progression or providing neuroprotection have failed over the last few decades. The lack of precision medicine approach in most of these trials could be one of the reasons why they were not successful. In the current review we discuss novel therapeutic approaches targeting GBA, LRRK2 and PRKN and discuss different aspects related to these genes and clinical trials.",NA,NA,NA

34628483,1,"Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia which precedes the onset of full psychotic symptoms, even in the ultra-high-risk stage (UHR). Polygenic risk scores (PRS) can be computed for many psychiatric disorders and phenotyping traits, including scores for resilience. We explored the correlations between several PRS and neurocognition in UHR individuals. We included 107 UHR individuals; 29.9% of them converted to psychosis (UHR-C) while 57.0% did not (UHR-NC) during the 1-year follow-up. Cognitive performances were assessed with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale estimating the Intelligence Quotient (IQ), the Trail Making Test, the verbal fluency, the Stroop test, and the Wisconsin card sorting test. Linear regression models were used to test their association with the PRS for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, ADHD, cross-disorders, cognitive performance, intelligence, education attainment, and resilience to schizophrenia. UHR-C had a lower IQ than UHR-NC. The PRS for schizophrenia negatively correlated with IQ, while the PRS for cognitive performance and for resilience positively correlated with IQ. PRS for schizophrenia showed a significant correlation with working memory and processing speed indices. PRS for schizophrenia showed a higher effect on IQ in UHR-NC, and UHR-NC with high PRS for schizophrenia had a similar IQ as UHR-C. Conversely, UHR-C with a high PRS for resilience performed as well as UHR-NC. Our findings suggest that cognitive deficits may predate the onset of psychosis. The genetic architecture of schizophrenia seems to impacts the cognition in UHR-NC. Cognition is also mediated by PRS for resilience.",NA,NA,NA
34630007,1,"Numerous neuroimaging studies demonstrated that the auditory cortex tracks ongoing speech and that, in multi-speaker environments, tracking of the attended speaker is enhanced compared to the other irrelevant speakers. In contrast to speech, multi-instrument music can be appreciated by attending not only on its individual entities (i.e., segregation) but also on multiple instruments simultaneously (i.e., integration). We investigated the neural correlates of these two modes of music listening using electroencephalography (EEG) and sound envelope tracking. To this end, we presented uniquely composed music pieces played by two instruments, a bassoon and a cello, in combination with a previously validated music auditory scene analysis behavioral paradigm (Disbergen et al., 2018). Similar to results obtained through selective listening tasks for speech, relevant instruments could be reconstructed better than irrelevant ones during the segregation task. A delay-specific analysis showed higher reconstruction for the relevant instrument during a middle-latency window for both the bassoon and cello and during a late window for the bassoon. During the integration task, we did not observe significant attentional modulation when reconstructing the overall music envelope. Subsequent analyses indicated that this null result might be due to the heterogeneous strategies listeners employ during the integration task. Overall, our results suggest that subsequent to a common processing stage, top-down modulations consistently enhance the relevant instrument's representation during an instrument segregation task, whereas such an enhancement is not observed during an instrument integration task. These findings extend previous results from speech tracking to the tracking of multi-instrument music and, furthermore, inform current theories on polyphonic music perception.",NA,NA,NA
34632384,1,"SNCA, the first gene associated with Parkinson's disease, encodes the α-synuclein protein, the predominant component within pathological inclusions termed Lewy bodies. The presence of Lewy bodies is one of the classical hallmarks found in the brain of patients with Parkinson's disease, and Lewy bodies have also been observed in patients with other synucleinopathies. However, the study of α-synuclein pathology in cells has relied largely on two-dimensional culture models, which typically lack the cellular diversity and complex spatial environment found in the brain. Here, to address this gap, we use three-dimensional midbrain organoids, differentiated from human-induced pluripotent stem cells derived from patients carrying a triplication of the SNCA gene and from CRISPR/Cas9 corrected isogenic control iPSCs. These human midbrain organoids recapitulate key features of α-synuclein pathology observed in the brains of patients with synucleinopathies. In particular, we find that SNCA triplication human midbrain organoids express elevated levels of α-synuclein and exhibit an age-dependent increase in α-synuclein aggregation, manifested by the presence of both oligomeric and phosphorylated forms of α-synuclein. These phosphorylated α-synuclein aggregates were found in both neurons and glial cells and their time-dependent accumulation correlated with a selective reduction in dopaminergic neuron numbers. Thus, human midbrain organoids from patients carrying SNCA gene multiplication can reliably model key pathological features of Parkinson's disease and provide a powerful system to study the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies.",NA,NA,NA

Using individual-level data (N = 20,190) from the UK Biobank, we provide estimates of the heritability of gray-matter volume in 74 regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain and we map genetic correlations between these ROIs and health-relevant behavioral outcomes, including intelligence. We find four genetically distinct clusters in the brain that are aligned with standard anatomical subdivision in neuroscience. Behavioral traits have distinct genetic correlations with brain morphology which suggests trait-specific relevance of ROIs. These empirical results illustrate how MGREML can be used to estimate internally consistent and high-dimensional genetic correlation matrices in large datasets.",NA,NA,NA

34657166,1,"Adult abilities in complex cognitive domains such as music appear to depend critically on the age at which training or experience begins, and relevant experience has greater long-term effects during periods of peak maturational change. Previous work has shown that early trained musicians (ET; < age 7) out-perform later-trained musicians (LT; > age 7) on tests of musical skill, and also have larger volumes of the ventral premotor cortex (vPMC) and smaller volumes of the cerebellum. These cortico-cerebellar networks mature and function in relation to one another, suggesting that early training may promote coordinated developmental plasticity. To test this hypothesis, we examined structural covariation between cerebellar volume and cortical thickness (CT) in sensorimotor regions in ET and LT musicians and non-musicians (NMs). Results show that ETs have smaller volumes in cerebellar lobules connected to sensorimotor cortices, while both musician groups had greater cortical thickness in right pre-supplementary motor area (SMA) and right PMC compared to NMs. Importantly, early musical training had a specific effect on structural covariance between the cerebellum and cortex: NMs showed negative correlations between left lobule VI and right pre-SMA and PMC, but this relationship was reduced in ET musicians. ETs instead showed a significant negative correlation between vermal IV and right pre-SMA and dPMC. Together, these results suggest that early musical training has differential impacts on the maturation of cortico-cerebellar networks important for optimizing sensorimotor performance. This conclusion is consistent with the hypothesis that connected brain regions interact during development to reciprocally influence brain and behavioral maturation.",NA,NA,NA

34678222,1,"The regulation of the apoptotic pathway is one of the most studied mechanisms regarding cancer cell resistance. Many mutations have been linked to drug resistance. The DNA fragmentation factor 40 (DFF40) has been gaining interest regarding cancer cell response to chemotherapy and patient outcomes. Glioblastomas and uterine leiomyosarcomas have been shown to have a downregulation of DFF40 expression, conferring a poor patient prognosis. In concordance with these observations, in this study, we showed that DFF40 gene is also downregulated in breast, endocervical, ovarian, lung, pancreas and glioblastomas. DFF40 is the endonuclease responsible of DNA fragmentation during apoptosis. In this study, we sought to determine if a DFF40 deficiency in Jurkat T cells could impact the sensitivity to conventional chemotherapy drugs. CRISPR-cas9 generated DFF40 knockout (DFF40 KO) stable Jurkat cells and wild-type (DFF40 WT) cells were treated with different antimetabolites and topoisomerase II (TOP2) inhibitors, and cell viability was subsequently assessed. DFF40 deficient cells show chemoresistance to antimetabolites (e.g. methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine and cytarabine) and surprisingly, they are more sensitive to TOP2 inhibitors (e.g. etoposide and teniposide). DFF40 deficient cells exposed to cytarabine present lower phosphatidylserine translocation levels to the outer cell membrane layer. Etoposide exposure in DFF40 deficient cells induces higher mortality levels and downregulation of Bcl-xL cells compared to DFF40 expressing T cells. The abolition of DFF40 expression in Jurkat cells significantly impairs histone H2AX phosphorylation following etoposide and cytarabine treatments.

It represents a promising technique for the evaluation of subtle, early signals of demyelination in the cerebral white matter of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Currently however, few studies exist that robustly assess the utility of ViSTa MWF measures of myelin compared to more conventional MRI measures of myelin in the brain of MS patients. Moreover, there are no previous studies evaluating the sensitivity of ViSTa MWF for the non-invasive detection of subtle tissue damage in both normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and white matter lesions of MS patients. As a result, a central purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate the relationship between myelin sensitivity of T1-based ViSTa MWF mapping and a more generally recognized metric, Magnetization Transfer Saturation (MTsat), in healthy control and MS brain white matter.",BACKGROUND,NA,NA

34704176,1,"In motor learning, sequence specificity, i.e. the learning of specific sequential associations, has predominantly been studied using task-based fMRI paradigms. However, offline changes in resting state functional connectivity after sequence-specific motor learning are less well understood. Previous research has established that plastic changes following motor learning can be divided into stages including fast learning, slow learning and retention. A description of how resting state functional connectivity after sequence-specific motor sequence learning (MSL) develops across these stages is missing. This study aimed to identify plastic alterations in whole-brain functional connectivity after learning a complex motor sequence by contrasting an active group who learned a complex sequence with a control group who performed a control task matched for motor execution. Resting state fMRI and behavioural performance were collected in both groups over the course of 5 consecutive training days and at follow-up after 12 days to encompass fast learning, slow learning, overall learning and retention. Between-group interaction analyses showed sequence-specific decreases in functional connectivity during overall learning in the right supplementary motor area (SMA). We found that connectivity changes in a key region of the motor network, the superior parietal cortex (SPC) were not a result of sequence-specific learning but were instead linked to motor execution.

Thicker right medial orbitofrontal/ventromedial prefrontal cortex (mOFC/vmPFC) was associated with higher schizotypy scores (r = 0.067, pFDR = 0.02). The cortical thickness profile in schizotypy was positively correlated with cortical abnormalities in SZ (r = 0.285, pspin = 0.024), but not BD (r = 0.166, pspin = 0.205) or MDD (r = -0.274, pspin = 0.073). The schizotypy-related subcortical volume pattern was negatively correlated with subcortical abnormalities in SZ (rho = -0.690, pspin = 0.006), BD (rho = -0.672, pspin = 0.009), and MDD (rho = -0.692, pspin = 0.004). Comprehensive mapping of schizotypy-related brain morphometry in the general population revealed a significant relationship between higher schizotypy and thicker mOFC/vmPFC, in the absence of confounding effects due to antipsychotic medication or disease chronicity. The cortical pattern similarity between schizotypy and schizophrenia yields new insights into a dimensional neurobiological continuity across the extended psychosis phenotype.",NA,NA,NA
34714115,1,"Older adults living with HIV may be at increased risk of experiencing distress during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We took advantage of a cohort study in older adults living with HIV in Canada (The Positive Brain Health Now [+BHN]) to study the psychological impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. A longitudinal study was conducted in which participants in the +BHN study who had access to the internet and agreed to be contacted were queried on symptoms of psychological distress and its predictors each week between mid-April and the end of June 2020. Evolution of distress, measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), was modeled using Group Based Trajectory Analysis and logistic regression was used to identify factors predictive of psychological distress in the clinical range. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the McGill University Health Center and all participants provided informed consent. The 77 +BHN participants who took part in this study were mostly men (92%) and on average 57.3 years of age. Over the study period, 32.5% experienced psychological distress in the clinical range at one or more weekly surveys. In the transition between the pre-COVID-19 and the COVID-19 periods, the HADS scores followed five distinct trajectories: (1) 39.5 % of the sample, with normal HADS scores in the several months preceding the pandemic, experienced an increase in HADS scores; (2) 30.6% of the sample had normal prepandemic HADS scores, remained stable; and (3) 29.9%, with prepandemic presence of distress, had a decrease in HADS scores. During the first wave of COVID-19, some attenuation in distress was seen over time. Feeling lonely and financial insecurity were associated with distress. Presence of psychological distress during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic was not universal among older adults with HIV, with as many as one third of the participants reporting an improvement in mental health. Distress was predicted by loneliness and financial insecurity.",NA,NA,NA
34715319,1,"Inter-individual variability in the functional organization of the brain presents a major obstacle to identifying generalizable neural coding principles. Functional alignment-a class of methods that matches subjects' neural signals based on their functional similarity-is a promising strategy for addressing this variability. To date, however, a range of functional alignment methods have been proposed and their relative performance is still unclear. In this work, we benchmark five functional alignment methods for inter-subject decoding on four publicly available datasets. Specifically, we consider three existing methods: piecewise Procrustes, searchlight Procrustes, and piecewise Optimal Transport. We also introduce and benchmark two new extensions of functional alignment methods: piecewise Shared Response Modelling (SRM), and intra-subject alignment. We find that functional alignment generally improves inter-subject decoding accuracy though the best performing method depends on the research context. Specifically, SRM and Optimal Transport perform well at both the region-of-interest level of analysis as well as at the whole-brain scale when aggregated through a piecewise scheme. We also benchmark the computational efficiency of each of the surveyed methods, providing insight into their usability and scalability. Taking inter-subject decoding accuracy as a quantification of inter-subject similarity, our results support the use of functional alignment to improve inter-subject comparisons in the face of variable structure-function organization. We provide open implementations of all methods used.",NA,NA,NA

34715425,2,Focal epilepsy patients that underwent stereo-electroencephalography implantation with at least one electrode in their hippocampus were selected (n = 75). The occurrence of spindles and barques in the hippocampus was evaluated in each patient. We created pairs of pathologic and pathology-free groups according to two sets of criteria: 1. Non-invasive diagnostic criteria (patients grouped according to focal epilepsy classification). 2. Intracranial neurophysiological criteria (patient's hippocampi grouped according to their seizure onset involvement).,METHODS,NA,NA

In Engel Class I patients, spindles occurred with similar incidence both within the non-invasive (P = 0.67) and the intracranial criteria group (P = 0.20). Barques were significantly more frequent in extra-temporal lobe epilepsy defined by either non-invasive (P = 0.01) or intracranial (P = 0.01) criteria.",RESULTS,NA,NA

34716395,1,"Quantifying changes in DNA and RNA levels is essential in numerous molecular biology protocols. Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) techniques have evolved to become commonplace, however, data analysis includes many time-consuming and cumbersome steps, which can lead to mistakes and misinterpretation of data. To address these bottlenecks, we have developed an open-source Python software to automate processing of result spreadsheets from qPCR machines, employing calculations usually performed manually. Auto-qPCR is a tool that saves time when computing qPCR data, helping to ensure reproducibility of qPCR experiment analyses. Our web-based app ( https://auto-q-pcr.com/ ) is easy to use and does not require programming knowledge or software installation. Using Auto-qPCR, we provide examples of data treatment, display and statistical analyses for four different data processing modes within one program: (1) DNA quantification to identify genomic deletion or duplication events; (2) assessment of gene expression levels using an absolute model, and relative quantification (3) with or (4) without a reference sample. Our open access Auto-qPCR software saves the time of manual data analysis and provides a more systematic workflow, minimizing the risk of errors. Our program constitutes a new tool that can be incorporated into bioinformatic and molecular biology pipelines in clinical and research labs.",NA,NA,NA
34724000,1,"The analysis of brain-imaging data requires complex processing pipelines to support findings on brain function or pathologies. Recent work has shown that variability in analytical decisions, small amounts of noise, or computational environments can lead to substantial differences in the results, endangering the trust in conclusions. We explored the instability of results by instrumenting a structural connectome estimation pipeline with Monte Carlo Arithmetic to introduce random noise throughout. We evaluated the reliability of the connectomes, the robustness of their features, and the eventual impact on analysis. The stability of results was found to range from perfectly stable (i.e. all digits of data significant) to highly unstable (i.e. 0 - 1 significant digits). This paper highlights the potential of leveraging induced variance in estimates of brain connectivity to reduce the bias in networks without compromising reliability, alongside increasing the robustness and potential upper-bound of their applications in the classification of individual differences. We demonstrate that stability evaluations are necessary for understanding error inherent to brain imaging experiments, and how numerical analysis can be applied to typical analytical workflows both in brain imaging and other domains of computational sciences, as the techniques used were data and context agnostic and globally relevant. Overall, while the extreme variability in results due to analytical instabilities could severely hamper our understanding of brain organization, it also affords us the opportunity to increase the robustness of findings.",NA,NA,NA
34728242,1,"A longstanding question in cognitive neuroscience and in the bilingualism literature is how early language experience influences brain development and cognitive outcomes, and whether these effects are global or specific to language-related processes. The current investigation examined the effect of the timing of language learning on the performance and neural correlates of phonological and non-verbal working memory, subcomponents of executive function. Three groups of bilinguals, who varied in terms of the timing of second language learning (i.e., simultaneous bilinguals learned their two languages from birth; early and late bilinguals who learned their second language before or after 5 years of age, respectively), performed phonological and non-verbal working memory tasks in the magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Results showed that there were no group differences in performance on either of the tasks, or in the neural correlates of performance of the non-verbal task. However, critically, we showed that despite similar behavioural performance, the groups differed in the patterns of neural recruitment during performance of the phonological working memory task. The pattern of group differences was non-linear, demonstrating similar neural recruitment for simultaneous and late bilinguals that differed from early bilinguals. Findings from the current study suggest a dynamic mapping between the brain and cognition, contributing to our current understanding of the effect of the timing of language learning on cognitive processes and demonstrating a specific effect on language-related executive function.",NA,NA,NA
34731636,1,"Projections from sensory neurons of olfactory systems coalesce into glomeruli in the brain. The Kirrel receptors are believed to homodimerize via their ectodomains and help separate sensory neuron axons into Kirrel2- or Kirrel3-expressing glomeruli. Here, we present the crystal structures of homodimeric Kirrel receptors and show that the closely related Kirrel2 and Kirrel3 have evolved specific sets of polar and hydrophobic interactions, respectively, disallowing heterodimerization while preserving homodimerization, likely resulting in proper segregation and coalescence of Kirrel-expressing axons into glomeruli. We show that the dimerization interface at the N-terminal immunoglobulin (IG) domains is necessary and sufficient to create homodimers and fail to find evidence for a secondary interaction site in Kirrel ectodomains. Furthermore, we show that abolishing dimerization of Kirrel3 in vivo leads to improper formation of glomeruli in the mouse accessory olfactory bulb as observed in Kirrel3-/- animals. Our results provide evidence for Kirrel3 homodimerization controlling axonal coalescence.",NA,NA,NA

However, less evidence has addressed the practicability of the strategy, because lack of a large-sample available real data for constructing DL model. In this work, we employed a large cohort (n = 2052) of peculiar data with both low through-plane resolution diagnostic and high-resolution isotropic brain MR images from identical subjects. By leveraging a series of SR approaches, including a proposed novel DL algorithm of Structure Constrained Super Resolution Network (SCSRN), the diagnostic images were transformed to high-resolution isotropic data to meet the criteria of brain research in voxel-based and surface-based morphometric analyses. We comprehensively assessed image quality and the practicability of the reconstructed data in a variety of morphometric analysis scenarios. We further compared the performance of SR approaches to the ground truth high-resolution isotropic data. The results showed (i) DL-based SR algorithms generally improve the quality of diagnostic images and render morphometric analysis more accurate, especially, with the most superior performance of the novel approach of SCSRN. (ii) Accuracies vary across brain structures and methods, and (iii) performance increases were higher for voxel than for surface based approaches. This study supports that DL-based image super-resolution potentially recycle huge amount of routine diagnostic brain MRI deposited in sleeping state, and turning them into useful data for neurometric research.",NA,NA,NA

However, recent methodological advances in acquisition and analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the spinal cord, either alone or in combination with the brain, have allowed us to gain further insights into the organization of this structure. In the current review, we conducted a systematic search to produced somatotopic maps of the spinal fMRI activity observed through different somatosensory, motor and resting-state paradigms. By cross-referencing these human neuroimaging findings with knowledge acquired through neurophysiological recordings, our review demonstrates that spinal fMRI is a powerful tool for exploring, in vivo, the human spinal cord pathways. We report strong cross-validation between task-related and resting-state fMRI in accordance with well-known hemicord, postero-anterior and rostro-caudal organization of these pathways. We also highlight the specific advantages of using spinal fMRI in clinical settings to characterize better spinal-related impairments, predict disease progression, and guide the implementation of therapeutic interventions.",NA,NA,NA

34753986,1,"Optic neuropathies such as glaucoma are characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration and death. The sigma-1 receptor (S1R) is an attractive target for treating optic neuropathies as it is highly expressed in RGCs, and its absence causes retinal degeneration. Activation of the S1R exerts neuroprotective effects in models of retinal degeneration. Pridopidine is a highly selective and potent S1R agonist in clinical development. We show that pridopidine exerts neuroprotection of retinal ganglion cells in two different rat models of glaucoma. Pridopidine strongly binds melanin, which is highly expressed in the retina. This feature of pridopidine has implications to its ocular distribution, bioavailability, and effective dose. Mitochondria dysfunction is a key contributor to retinal ganglion cell degeneration. Pridopidine rescues mitochondrial function via activation of the S1R, providing support for the potential mechanism driving its neuroprotective effect in retinal ganglion cells.",NA,NA,NA

Hence, understanding of hippocampal function likely demands characterizing both medial-to-lateral and anterior-to-posterior axes, an approach that has been concretized by recent advances in in vivo parcellation and gradient mapping techniques.

We demonstrate that Sox6 expression distinguishes ventrally and dorsally biased DA neuron populations in the SNc. The Sox6+ population in the ventral SNc includes an Aldh1a1+ subset and is enriched in gene pathways that underpin vulnerability. Sox6+ neurons project to the dorsal striatum and show activity correlated with acceleration. Sox6- neurons project to the medial, ventral, and caudal striatum and respond to rewards.

34761459,1,"Both cortical and subcortical structures are organized into a large number of distinct areas reflecting functional and cytoarchitectonic differences. Mapping these areas is of fundamental importance to neuroscience. A central obstacle to this task is the inaccuracy associated with bringing results from individuals into a common space. The vast individual differences in morphology pose a serious problem for volumetric registration. Surface-based approaches fare substantially better, but have thus far been used only for cortical parcellation, leaving subcortical parcellation in volumetric space. We extend the surface-based approach to include also the subcortical deep gray-matter structures, thus achieving a uniform representation across both cortex and subcortex, suitable for use with surface-based metrics that span these structures, for example, white/gray contrast. Using data from the Enhanced Nathan Klein Institute-Rockland Sample, limited to individuals between 19 and 69 years of age, we generate a functional parcellation of both the cortical and subcortical surfaces. To assess this extended parcellation, we show that (a) our parcellation provides greater homogeneity of functional connectivity patterns than do arbitrary parcellations matching in the number and size of parcels; (b) our parcels align with known cortical and subcortical architecture; and (c) our extended functional parcellation provides an improved fit to the complexity of life-span (6-85 years) changes in white/gray contrast data compared to arbitrary parcellations matching in the number and size of parcels, supporting its use with surface-based measures.

34774970,1,"The common marmoset has emerged as a popular model in neuroscience research, in part due to its reproductive efficiency, genetic and neuroanatomical similarities to humans and the successful generation of transgenic lines. Stereotaxic procedures in marmosets are guided by 2D stereotaxic atlases, which are constructed with a limited number of animals and fail to account for inter-individual variability in skull and brain size. Here, we developed a frameless imaging-guided stereotaxic system that improves upon traditional approaches by using subject-specific registration of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) data to identify a surgical target, namely the putamen, in two marmosets. The skull surface was laser-scanned to create a point cloud that was registered to the 3D reconstruction of the skull from CT. Reconstruction of the skull, as well as of the brain from MR images, was crucial for surgical planning. Localisation and injection into the putamen was done using a 6-axis robotic arm controlled by a surgical navigation software (Brainsight™). Integration of subject-specific registration and frameless stereotaxic navigation allowed target localisation specific to each animal. Injection of alpha-synuclein fibrils into the putamen triggered progressive neurodegeneration of the nigro-striatal system, a key feature of Parkinson's disease. Four months post-surgery, a PET scan found evidence of nigro-striatal denervation, supporting accurate targeting of the putamen during co-registration and subsequent surgery.

34776932,1,"In older adults, motor sequence learning (MSL) is largely intact. However, consolidation of newly learned motor sequences is impaired compared to younger adults, and there is evidence that brain areas supporting enhanced consolidation via sleep degrade with age. It is known that brain activity in hippocampal-cortical-striatal areas is important for sleep-dependent, off-line consolidation of motor-sequences. Yet, the intricacies of how both age and sleep alter communication within this network of brain areas, which facilitate consolidation, are not known. In this study, 37 young (age 20-35) and 49 older individuals (age 55-75) underwent resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after training on a MSL task as well as after either a nap or a period of awake rest. Young participants who napped showed strengthening of functional connectivity (FC) between motor, striatal, and hippocampal areas, compared to older subjects regardless of sleep condition. Follow-up analyses revealed this effect was driven by younger participants who showed an increase in FC between striatum and motor cortices, as well as older participants who showed decreased FC between the hippocampus, striatum, and precuneus. Therefore, different effects of sleep were observed in younger vs. older participants, where young participants primarily showed increased communication in the striatal-motor areas, while older participants showed decreases in key nodes of the default mode network and striatum. Performance gains correlated with FC changes in young adults, and this association was much greater in participants who napped compared to those who stayed awake. Performance gains also correlated with FC changes in older adults, but only in those who napped. This study reveals that, while there is no evidence of time-dependent forgetting/deterioration of performance, older adults exhibit a completely different pattern of FC changes during consolidation compared to younger adults, and lose the benefit that sleep affords to memory consolidation.",NA,NA,NA

Applying three prototypical analyses to the outputs of 750,000 unique processing pipelines, we find that choice of pipeline has a large impact on research findings, with parameters commonly varied in the literature influencing correlations between derived gene expression and other imaging phenotypes by as much as ρ ≥ 1.0. Our results further reveal an ordering of parameter importance, with processing steps that influence gene normalization yielding the greatest impact on downstream statistical inferences and conclusions.

34793534,1,"Here, we sought to quantify the effects of experienced fear and worry, engendered by the COVID-19 pandemic, on both cognitive abilities-speed of information processing, task-set shifting, and proactive control-as well as economic risk-taking. Leveraging a repeated-measures cross-sectional design, we examined the performance of 1517 participants, collected during the early phase of the pandemic in the US (April-June 2020), finding that self-reported pandemic-related worry predicted deficits in information processing speed and maintenance of goal-related contextual information. In a classic economic risk-taking task, we observed that worried individuals' choices were more sensitive to the described outcome probabilities of risky actions. Overall, these results elucidate the cognitive consequences of a large-scale, unpredictable, and uncontrollable stressor, which may in turn play an important role in individuals' understanding of, and adherence to safety directives both in the current crisis and future public health emergencies.",NA,NA,NA
34793536,1,"Many studies have focused on neural changes and neuroplasticity, while the signaling demand for neural modification needs to be explored. In this study, we traced this issue in the organization of brain functional links where the conflictual arrangement of signed links makes a request to change. We introduced the number of frustrations (unsatisfied closed triadic interactions) as a measure for assessing ""requirement to change"" of functional brain network. We revealed that the requirement to change of the resting-state network has a u-shape functionality over the lifespan with a minimum in early adulthood, and it's correlated with the presence of negative links. Also, we discovered that brain negative subnetwork has a special topology with a log-normal degree distribution in all stages, however, its global measures are altered by adulthood. Our results highlight the study of collective behavior of functional negative links as the source of the brain's between-regions conflicts and we propose exploring the attribute of the requirement to change besides other neural change factors.",NA,NA,NA
34796871,1,"SARM1, a protein with critical NADase activity, is a central executioner in a conserved programme of axon degeneration. We report seven rare missense or in-frame microdeletion human SARM1 variant alleles in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or other motor nerve disorders that alter the SARM1 auto-inhibitory ARM domain and constitutively hyperactivate SARM1 NADase activity. The constitutive NADase activity of these seven variants is similar to that of SARM1 lacking the entire ARM domain and greatly exceeds the activity of wild-type SARM1, even in the presence of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), its physiological activator. This rise in constitutive activity alone is enough to promote neuronal degeneration in response to otherwise non-harmful, mild stress. Importantly, these strong gain-of-function alleles are completely patient-specific in the cohorts studied and show a highly significant association with disease at the single gene level. These findings of disease-associated coding variants that alter SARM1 function build on previously reported genome-wide significant association with ALS for a neighbouring, more common SARM1 intragenic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to support a contributory role of SARM1 in these disorders. A broad phenotypic heterogeneity and variable age-of-onset of disease among patients with these alleles also raises intriguing questions about the pathogenic mechanism of hyperactive SARM1 variants.",NA,NA,NA

However, there are a few specific cloud platforms that seek to address the cloud computational challenges of EEG big data analysis to benefit the EEG community. In response to the challenges, a WeBrain cloud platform (https://webrain.uestc.edu.cn/) is designed as a web-based brainformatics platform and computational ecosystem to enable large-scale EEG data storage, exploration and analysis using cloud high-performance computing (HPC) facilities. WeBrain connects researchers from different fields to EEG and multimodal tools that have become the norm in the field and the cloud processing power required to handle those large EEG datasets. This platform provides an easy-to-use system for novice users (even no computer programming skills) and provides satisfactory maintainability, sustainability and flexibility for IT administrators and tool developers. A range of resources are also available on https://webrain.uestc.edu.cn/, including documents, manuals, example datasets related to WeBrain, and collected links to open EEG datasets and tools. It is not necessary for users or administrators to install any software or system, and all that is needed is a modern web browser, which reduces the technical expertise required to use or manage WeBrain. The WeBrain platform is sponsored and driven by the China-Canada-Cuba international brain cooperation project (CCC-Axis, http://ccc-axis.org/), and we hope that WeBrain will be a promising cloud brainformatics platform for exploring brain information in large-scale EEG applications in the EEG community.",NA,NA,NA
34799457,1,"Stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) is not only a sophisticated and highly technological investigation but a new and better way to conceptualize the spatial and temporal dynamics of epileptic activity. The first intracranial investigations with SEEG were carried out in France in the mid-twentieth century; however, its use in North America is much more recent. Given its significantly lower risk of complications and its ability to sample both superficial and deep structures as well as both hemispheres simultaneously, SEEG has become the preferred method to conduct intracranial EEG monitoring in most comprehensive epilepsy centers in North America. SEEG is an invasive neurophysiological methodology used for advanced pre-surgical work-up in the 20% of drug-resistant patients with more complex focal epilepsy in whom non-invasive investigations do not allow to decide on surgical candidacy. SEEG uses stereotactically-implanted depth electrodes to map the origin and propagation of epileptic seizures by creating a three-dimensional representation of the abnormal electrical activity in the brain. SEEG analysis takes into account the background, interictal, and ictal activity, as well as the results of cortical electrical stimulation procedures, to reliably delineate the epileptogenic network. By means of a clinical vignette, this article will walk general neurologists, but especially neurology trainees through the immense potential of this methodology. In summary, SEEG enables to accurately identify the epileptogenic zone in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who otherwise would be not amenable to surgical treatment, the best way to improve seizure control and achieve seizure-freedom in this patient population.",NA,NA,NA
34800398,1,Therapeutic options for children with multiple sclerosis are scarce. Teriflunomide is approved in more than 80 countries for the treatment of adults with relapsing multiple sclerosis. The TERIKIDS study examined the safety and efficacy of teriflunomide in children with relapsing multiple sclerosis.,BACKGROUND,NA,NA

The trial enrolled patients aged 10-17 years, diagnosed with relapsing multiple sclerosis and with at least one relapse in the year preceding screening or at least two relapses in the 2 years preceding screening. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to oral teriflunomide (dosage equivalent to 14 mg in adults) or matching placebo, using an interactive web and voice response system, for up to 96 weeks. Personnel in all sites and all patients were masked to study treatment in the double-blind period. Early entry into a subsequent 96-week open-label extension phase was possible before the end of the double-blind period for patients with confirmed clinical relapse or high MRI activity (at least five new or enlarged T2 lesions at week 24, followed by at least nine new or enlarged T2 lesions at week 36, or at least five new or enlarged T2 lesions at weeks 36 and 48, or at weeks 48 and 72). The primary endpoint was time to first confirmed clinical relapse by the end of the double-blind period. Key secondary imaging endpoints were number of new or enlarged T2 lesions and number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions per MRI scan. Efficacy endpoints were analysed in the intention-to-treat population, and safety was assessed in all patients randomly assigned to treatment and exposed to the double-blind study medication.

Switch to the ongoing open-label extension because of high MRI activity was more frequent than anticipated in the placebo group (14 [13%] of 109 patients in the teriflunomide group vs 15 [26%] of 57 in the placebo group), decreasing the power of the study. After 96 weeks, there was no difference in time to first confirmed clinical relapse with teriflunomide compared with placebo (hazard ratio 0·66, 95% CI 0·39-1·11; p=0·29). Teriflunomide reduced the number of new or enlarged T2 lesions versus placebo by 55% (relative risk 0·45, 95% CI 0·29-0·71; p=0·00061), and the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions by 75% (relative risk 0·25, 0·13-0·51; p<0·0001). Adverse events occurred in 96 (88%) patients in the teriflunomide group and 47 (82%) patients in the placebo group; serious adverse events occurred in 12 (11%) patients in the teriflunomide group and 6 (11%) patients in the placebo group. Nasopharyngitis, upper-respiratory-tract infection, alopecia, paraesthesia, abdominal pain, and increased blood creatine phosphokinase were more frequent with teriflunomide than with placebo.

34817294,1,"Social interaction complexity makes humans unique. But in times of social deprivation, this strength risks exposure of important vulnerabilities. Human social neuroscience studies have placed a premium on the default network (DN). In contrast, hippocampus (HC) subfields have been intensely studied in rodents and monkeys. To bridge these two literatures, we here quantified how DN subregions systematically covary with specific HC subfields in the context of subjective social isolation (i.e., loneliness). By codecomposition using structural brain scans of ∼40,000 UK Biobank participants, loneliness was specially linked to midline subregions in the uncovered DN patterns. These association cortex patterns coincided with concomitant HC patterns implicating especially CA1 and molecular layer. These patterns also showed a strong affiliation with the fornix white matter tract and the nucleus accumbens. In addition, separable signatures of structural HC-DN covariation had distinct associations with the genetic predisposition for loneliness at the population level.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The hippocampus and default network have been implicated in rich social interaction. Yet, these allocortical and neocortical neural systems have been interrogated in mostly separate literatures. Here, we conjointly investigate the hippocampus and default network at a subregion level, by capitalizing structural brain scans from ∼40,000 participants. We thus reveal unique insights on the nature of the ""lonely brain"" by estimating the regimes of covariation between the hippocampus and default network at population scale.",NA,NA,NA

34843206,1,"Glycine is an important biomarker in clinical analysis due to its involvement in multiple physiological processes. As such, the need for low-cost analytical tools for glycine detection is growing. As a neurotransmitter, glycine is involved in inhibitory and excitatory neurochemical transmission in the central nervous system. In this work, we present a 10 μM Pt-based electrochemical enzymatic biosensor based on the flavoenzyme glycine oxidase (GO) for localized real-time measurements of glycine. Among GO variants at position 244, the H244K variant with increased glycine turnover was selected to develop a functional biosensor. This biosensor relies on amperometric readouts and does not require additional redox mediators. The biosensor was characterized and applied for glycine detection from cells, mainly HEK 293 cells and primary rat astrocytes. We have identified an enzyme, GO H244K, with increased glycine turnover using mutagenesis but which can be developed into a functional biosensor. Noteworthy, a glycine release of 395.7 ± 123 μM from primary astrocytes was measured, which is ∼fivefold higher than glycine release from HEK 293 cells (75.4 ± 3.91 μM) using the GO H244K biosensor.",NA,NA,NA
34845190,1,"Lithium is the gold standard therapy for Bipolar Disorder (BD) but its effectiveness differs widely between individuals. The molecular mechanisms underlying treatment response heterogeneity are not well understood, and personalized treatment in BD remains elusive. Genetic analyses of the lithium treatment response phenotype may generate novel molecular insights into lithium's therapeutic mechanisms and lead to testable hypotheses to improve BD management and outcomes. We used fixed effect meta-analysis techniques to develop meta-analytic polygenic risk scores (MET-PRS) from combinations of highly correlated psychiatric traits, namely schizophrenia (SCZ), major depression (MD) and bipolar disorder (BD). We compared the effects of cross-disorder MET-PRS and single genetic trait PRS on lithium response. For the PRS analyses, we included clinical data on lithium treatment response and genetic information for n = 2283 BD cases from the International Consortium on Lithium Genetics (ConLi+Gen; www.ConLiGen.org ). Higher SCZ and MD PRSs were associated with poorer lithium treatment response whereas BD-PRS had no association with treatment outcome. The combined MET2-PRS comprising of SCZ and MD variants (MET2-PRS) and a model using SCZ and MD-PRS sequentially improved response prediction, compared to single-disorder PRS or to a combined score using all three traits (MET3-PRS). Patients in the highest decile for MET2-PRS loading had 2.5 times higher odds of being classified as poor responders than patients with the lowest decile MET2-PRS scores.

34852233,1,"Pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a prefrontal region involved in processing the affective components of pain, display hyperexcitability in chronic neuropathic pain conditions, and their silencing abolishes hyperalgesia. We show that dopamine, through D1 receptor (D1R) signaling, inhibits pyramidal neurons of mouse ACC by modulation of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels. Activation of Gs-coupled D1R by dopamine induces the opening of HCN channels at physiological membrane potentials, driving a significant decrease in input resistance and excitability. Systemic L-DOPA in chronic neuropathic mice rescues HCN channel activity, normalizes pyramidal excitability in ACC, and blocks mechanical and thermal allodynia. Moreover, microinjection of a selective D1R agonist in the ACC relieves the aversiveness of ongoing neuropathic pain, while an ACC D1R antagonist blocks gabapentin- and lidocaine-evoked antinociception. We conclude that dopaminergic inhibition via D1R in ACC plays an analgesic role in physiological conditions and is decreased in chronic pain.",NA,NA,NA
34859216,1,"Brain atrophy has been reported in the early stages of Parkinson's disease, but there have been few longitudinal studies. How intrinsic properties of the brain, such as anatomical connectivity, local cell-type distribution and gene expression combine to determine the pattern of disease progression also remains unknown. One hypothesis proposes that the disease stems from prion-like propagation of misfolded alpha-synuclein via the connectome that might cause varying degrees of tissue damage based on local properties. Here, we used MRI data from the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative to map the progression of brain atrophy over 1, 2 and 4 years compared with baseline. We derived atrophy maps for four time points using deformation-based morphometry applied to T1-weighted MRI from 120 de novo Parkinson's disease patients, 74 of whom had imaging at all four time points (50 Men: 24 Women) and 157 healthy control participants (115 Men: 42 Women). In order to determine factors that may influence neurodegeneration, we related atrophy progression to brain structural and functional connectivity, cell-type expression and gene ontology enrichment analyses. After regressing out the expected age and sex effects associated with normal ageing, we found that atrophy significantly progressed over 2 and 4 years in the caudate, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus and posterior cortical regions. This progression was shaped by both structural and functional brain connectivity. Also, the progression of atrophy was more pronounced in regions with a higher expression of genes related to synapses and was inversely related to the prevalence of oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells. In sum, we demonstrate that the progression of atrophy in Parkinson's disease is in line with the prion-like propagation hypothesis of alpha-synuclein and provide evidence that synapses may be especially vulnerable to synucleinopathy. In addition to identifying vulnerable brain regions, this study reveals different factors that may be implicated in the neurotoxic mechanisms leading to progression in Parkinson's disease.

34860155,1,"Neurodevelopmental axonal pathfinding plays a central role in correct brain wiring and subsequent cognitive abilities. Within the growth cone, various intracellular effectors transduce axonal guidance signals by remodeling the cytoskeleton. Semaphorin-3E (Sema3E) is a guidance cue implicated in development of the fornix, a neuronal tract connecting the hippocampus to the hypothalamus. Microtubule-associated protein 6 (MAP6) has been shown to be involved in the Sema3E growth-promoting signaling pathway. In this study, we identified the collapsin response mediator protein 4 (CRMP4) as a MAP6 partner and a crucial effector in Sema3E growth-promoting activity. CRMP4-KO mice displayed abnormal fornix development reminiscent of that observed in Sema3E-KO mice. CRMP4 was shown to interact with the Sema3E tripartite receptor complex within detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) domains, and DRM domain integrity was required to transduce Sema3E signaling through the Akt/GSK3 pathway. Finally, we showed that the cytoskeleton-binding domain of CRMP4 is required for Sema3E's growth-promoting activity, suggesting that CRMP4 plays a role at the interface between Sema3E receptors, located in DRM domains, and the cytoskeleton network. As the fornix is affected in many psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia, our results provide new insights to better understand the neurodevelopmental components of these diseases.",NA,NA,NA

34872458,1,"Long-term cognitive deficits have been observed in some children who experience an acquired demyelinating syndrome (ADS). We examined changes in cognitive functioning over the first two years following incident ADS andtested whether normalized brain and thalamic volume accounted for decline over time. Twenty-five youth (mean age 12.8 years) with ADS, 9 of whom were diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) and 16 of whom experienced monophasic ADS (monoADS), underwent two neuropsychological evaluationsand MRI scans at approximately6- and 24-months post ADS-onset. We examined changes in cognitive outcomes over time and between patient groups. Generalized linear mixed-effect regression models were used to examine the association of normalized brain and thalamic volumesbetween the two timepointswith cognitive z-scores. Cognitive performance was within the age-expected range for both groups and remained stable over time on 15 measures. In the combined sample of monoADS and MS patients, declines (p < .05) were noted on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), the Auditory Working Memory (AWM), and the WJ-III Visual Matching (VisMat)tests, but did not survive FDR correction. Clinically significant declines, as measured by the Reliable Change Index, were observed on the SDMT,AWM, and VisMattests by 19, 42, and 32%, respectively. Lower normalized brain volume at 6-months predicted a negative change in SDMT (B = 0.45, 95%CI: 0.07,0.83) and AWM (B = 0.30, 95%CI: 0.13, 0.47). Chronicity of demyelination is not required for cognitive decline nor for reduced brain volume, suggesting that even a single demyelinating event may negatively impact cognitive potential in children.",NA,NA,NA

We identified 107 high-confidence MDV cargoes, which include all β-barrel proteins and the TOM import complex. MDV cargoes are delivered as fully assembled complexes to lysosomes, thus representing a selective mitochondrial quality control mechanism for multi-subunit complexes, including the TOM machinery.

The combination of all ALS-associated signals reveals a role for perturbations in vesicle-mediated transport and autophagy and provides evidence for cell-autonomous disease initiation in glutamatergic neurons.",NA,NA,NA
34874596,1,"The presymptomatic stages of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are still poorly defined and encompass a long accrual of progressive biological (preclinical) and then clinical (prodromal) changes, antedating the onset of dementia. The heterogeneity of clinical presentations and the different neuropathological phenotypes have prevented a prior clear description of either preclinical or prodromal FTD. Recent advances in therapeutic approaches, at least in monogenic disease, demand a proper definition of these predementia stages. It has become clear that a consensus lexicon is needed to comprehensively describe the stages that anticipate dementia. The goal of the present work is to review existing literature on the preclinical and prodromal phases of FTD, providing recommendations to address the unmet questions, therefore laying out a strategy for operationalizing and better characterizing these presymptomatic disease stages.",NA,NA,NA
34875213,1,"Mutations in PINK1 cause autosomal-recessive Parkinson's disease. Mitochondrial damage results in PINK1 import arrest on the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex, resulting in the activation of its ubiquitin kinase activity by autophosphorylation and initiation of Parkin-dependent mitochondrial clearance. Herein, we report crystal structures of the entire cytosolic domain of insect PINK1. Our structures reveal a dimeric autophosphorylation complex targeting phosphorylation at the invariant Ser205 (human Ser228). The dimer interface requires insert 2, which is unique to PINK1. The structures also reveal how an N-terminal helix binds to the C-terminal extension and provide insights into stabilization of PINK1 on the core TOM complex.",NA,NA,NA

34906715,1,"We present both a scientific overview and conceptual positions concerning the challenges and assets of electrophysiological measurements in the search for the nature and functions of the human connectome. We discuss how the field has been inspired by findings and approaches from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and informed by a small number of significant multimodal empirical studies, which show that the canonical networks that are commonplace in fMRI are in fact rooted in electrophysiological processes. This review is also an opportunity to produce a brief, up-to-date critical survey of current data modalities and analytical methods available for deriving both static and dynamic connectomes from electrophysiology. We review hurdles that challenge the significance and impact of current electrophysiology connectome research. We then encourage the field to take a leap of faith and embrace the wealth of electrophysiological signals, despite their apparent, disconcerting complexity. Our position is that electrophysiology connectomics is poised to inform testable mechanistic models of information integration in hierarchical brain networks, constructed from observable oscillatory and aperiodic signal components and their polyrhythmic interactions.",NA,NA,NA
34908212,1,"Progressive cerebral degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains poorly understood. Here, three-dimensional (3D) texture analysis was used to study longitudinal gray and white matter cerebral degeneration in ALS from routine T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Participants were included from the Canadian ALS Neuroimaging Consortium (CALSNIC) who underwent up to three clinical assessments and MRI at four-month intervals, up to 8 months after baseline (T0 ). Three-dimensional maps of the texture feature autocorrelation were computed from T1-weighted images. One hundred and nineteen controls and 137 ALS patients were included, with 81 controls and 84 ALS patients returning for at least one follow-up. At baseline, texture changes in ALS patients were detected in the motor cortex, corticospinal tract, insular cortex, and bilateral frontal and temporal white matter compared to controls. Longitudinal comparison of texture maps between T0 and Tmax (last follow-up visit) within ALS patients showed progressive texture alterations in the temporal white matter, insula, and internal capsule. Additionally, when compared to controls, ALS patients had greater texture changes in the frontal and temporal structures at Tmax than at T0 . In subgroup analysis, slow progressing ALS patients had greater progressive texture change in the internal capsule than the fast progressing patients. Contrastingly, fast progressing patients had greater progressive texture changes in the precentral gyrus. These findings suggest that the characteristic longitudinal gray matter pathology in ALS is the progressive involvement of frontotemporal regions rather than a worsening pathology within the motor cortex, and that phenotypic variability is associated with distinct progressive spatial pathology.",NA,NA,NA

34920084,1,"During the past decades there has been an increasing interest in tracking brain network fluctuations in health and disease by means of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Rs-fMRI however does not provide the ideal environmental setting, as participants are continuously exposed to noise generated by MRI coils during acquisition of Echo Planar Imaging (EPI). We investigated the effect of EPI noise on resting state activity and connectivity using magnetoencephalography (MEG), by reproducing the acoustic characteristics of rs-fMRI environment during the recordings. As compared to fMRI, MEG has little sensitivity to brain activity generated in deep brain structures, but has the advantage to capture both the dynamic of cortical magnetic oscillations with high temporal resolution and the slow magnetic fluctuations highly correlated with BOLD signal.",INTRODUCTION,NA,NA
34920084,2,"Thirty healthy subjects were enrolled in a counterbalanced design study including three conditions: a) silent resting state (Silence), b) resting state upon EPI noise (fMRI), and c) resting state upon white noise (White). White noise was employed to test the specificity of fMRI noise effect. The amplitude envelope correlation (AEC) in alpha band measured the connectivity of seven Resting State Networks (RSN) of interest (default mode network, dorsal attention network, language, left and right auditory and left and right sensory-motor). Vigilance dynamic was estimated from power spectral activity.",METHODS,NA,NA

34923132,1,"The principle of resting-state paradigms is appealing and practical for collecting data from impaired patients and special populations, especially if data collection times can be minimized. To achieve this goal, researchers need to ensure estimated signal features of interest are robust. In electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG, MEG) we are not aware of any studies of the minimal length of data required to yield a robust one-session snapshot of the frequency-spectrum derivatives that are typically used to characterize the complex dynamics of the brain's resting-state. We aimed to fill this knowledge gap by studying the stability of common spectral measures of resting-state MEG source time series obtained from large samples of single-session recordings from shared data repositories featuring different recording conditions and instrument technologies (OMEGA: N = 107; Cam-CAN: N = 50). We discovered that the rhythmic and arrhythmic spectral properties of intrinsic brain activity can be robustly estimated in most cortical regions when derived from relatively short segments of 30-s to 120-s of resting-state data, regardless of instrument technology and resting-state paradigm. Using an adapted leave-one-out approach and Bayesian analysis, we also provide evidence that the stability of spectral features over time is unaffected by age, sex, handedness, and general cognitive function. In summary, short MEG sessions are sufficient to yield robust estimates of frequency-defined brain activity during resting-state. This study may help guide future empirical designs in the field, particularly when recording times need to be minimized, such as with patient or special populations.",NA,NA,NA
34927199,1,"Diffusely abnormal white matter, characterised by biochemical changes of myelin in the absence of frank demyelination, has been associated with clinical progression in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. However, little is known about changes of diffusely abnormal white matter over time and their relation to focal white matter lesions. The objectives of this work were: (i) to characterize the longitudinal evolution of focal white matter lesions, diffusely abnormal white matter and diffusely abnormal white matter that transforms into focal white matter lesions; and (ii) to determine whether gadolinium enhancement, known to be associated with the development of new focal white matter lesions, is also related to diffusely abnormal white matter voxels that transform into focal white matter lesions. Our data included 4220 MRI scans of 689 secondary progressive multiple sclerosis participants, followed for 156 weeks, and 2677 scans of 686 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis participants, followed for 96 weeks. Focal white matter lesions and diffusely abnormal white matter were segmented using a previously validated, automatic thresholding technique based on normalized T2 intensity values. Using longitudinally registered images, diffusely abnormal white matter voxels at each visit that transformed into focal white matter lesions on the last MRI scan as well as their overlap with gadolinium-enhancing lesion masks were identified. Our results showed that the average yearly rate of conversion of diffusely abnormal white matter to focal white matter lesions was 1.27 cm3 for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and 0.80 cm3 for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Focal white matter lesions in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis participants significantly increased (t = 3.9; P = 0.0001) while diffusely abnormal white matter significantly decreased (t = -4.3 P < 0.0001) and the ratio of focal white matter lesions to diffusely abnormal white matter increased (t = 12.7; P < 0.00001). Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis participants also showed an increase in the focal white matter lesions to diffusely abnormal white matter ratio (t = 6.9; P < 0.00001) but without a significant change of the individual volumes. Gadolinium enhancement was associated with 7.3% and 18.7% of focal new T2 lesion formation in the infrequent scans of the relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis cohorts, respectively. In comparison, only 0.1% and 0.0% of diffusely abnormal white matter to focal white matter lesions voxels overlapped with gadolinium enhancement. We conclude that diffusely abnormal white matter transforms into focal white matter lesions over time in both relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Diffusely abnormal white matter appears to represent a form of pre-lesional pathology that contributes to T2 lesion volume increase over time, independent of new focal inflammation and gadolinium enhancement.",NA,NA,NA

34950086,1,"Importance: Given the importance of apathy for stroke, we felt it was time to scrutinize the psychometric properties of the commonly used Starkstein Apathy Scale (SAS) for this purpose. Objectives: The objectives were to: (i) estimate the extent to which the SAS items fit a hierarchical continuum of the Rasch Model; and (ii) estimate the strength of the relationships between the Rasch analyzed SAS and converging constructs related to stroke outcomes. Methods: Data was from a clinical trial of a community-based intervention targeting participation. A total of 857 SAS questionnaires were completed by 238 people with stroke from up to 5 time points. SAS has 14 items, rated on a 4-point scale with higher values indicating more apathy. Psychometric properties were tested using Rasch partial-credit model, correlation, and regression. Items were rescored so higher scores are interpreted as lower apathy levels. Results: Rasch analysis indicated that the response options were disordered for 8/14 items, pointing to unreliability in the interpretation of the response options; they were consequently reduced from 4 to 3. Only 9/14 items fit the Rasch model and therefore suitable for creating a total score. The new rSAS was deemed unidimensional (residual correlations: < 0.3), reasonably reliable (person separation index: 0.74), with item-locations uniform across time, age, sex, and education. However, 30% of scores were > 2 SD above the standardized mean but only 2/9 items covered this range (construct mistargeting). Apathy (rSAS/SAS) was correlated weakly with anxiety/depression and uncorrelated with physical capacity. Regression showed that the effect of apathy on participation and health perception was similar for rSAS/SAS versions: R2 participation measures ranged from 0.11 to 0.29; R2 for health perception was ∼0.25. When placed on the same scale (0-42), rSAS value was 6.5 units lower than SAS value with minimal floor/ceiling effects. Estimated change over time was identical (0.12 units/month) which was not substantial (1.44 units/year) but greater than expected assuming no change (t: 3.6 and 2.4). Conclusion: The retained items of the rSAS targeted domains of behaviors more than beliefs and results support the rSAS as a robust measure of apathy in people with chronic stroke.",NA,NA,NA
34954302,1,"L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) is the mainstay treatment for Parkinson's disease, but its effectiveness during early disease is marred by the eventual development of l-DOPA induced dyskinesia. In hemi-parkinsonian rats, the serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) antagonists ondansetron and granisetron alleviated dyskinesia induced by l-DOPA without impeding its anti-parkinsonian action; in parkinsonian marmosets, ondansetron alleviated dyskinesia and enhanced l-DOPA anti-parkinsonian action. Here, we sought to gain insight into the mechanisms governing the anti-dyskinetic action of 5-HT3 antagonists and measured 5-HT3 receptor levels across different brain, using [3H]GR65630 autoradiographic binding. Brain sections were chosen from 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats exhibiting abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs), as well as l-DOPA-naïve 6-OHDA and sham-lesioned animals. [3H]GR65630 binding increased in the ipsilateral subthalamic nucleus of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats with mild and severe AIMs, (3-fold changes, P < 0.001).

34991017,1,We hypothesized that spatio-temporal dynamics of interictal spikes reflect the extent and stability of epileptic sources and determine surgical outcome.,OBJECTIVE,NA,NA
34991017,2,"We studied 30 consecutive patients (14 good outcome). Spikes were detected in prolonged stereo-electroencephalography recordings. We quantified the spatio-temporal dynamics of spikes using the variance of the spike rate, line length and skewness of the spike distribution, and related these features to outcome. We built a logistic regression model, and compared its performance to traditional markers.",METHODS,NA,NA
34991017,3,"Good outcome patients had more dominant and stable sources than poor outcome patients as expressed by a higher variance of spike rates, a lower variance of line length, and a lower variance of positive skewness (ps < 0.05). The outcome was correctly predicted in 80% of patients. This was better or non-inferior to predictions based on a focal lesion (p = 0.016), focal seizure-onset zone, or complete resection (ps > 0.05). In the five patients where traditional markers failed, spike distribution predicted the outcome correctly. The best results were achieved by 18-h periods or longer.",RESULTS,NA,NA

35014820,1,"Brain organoids are three-dimensional, tissue-engineered neural models derived from induced pluripotent stem cells that enable studies of neurodevelopmental and disease processes. Mechanical properties of the microenvironment are known to be critical parameters in tissue engineering, but the mechanical consequences of the encapsulating matrix on brain organoid growth and development remain undefined. Here, Matrigel was modified with an interpenetrating network (IPN) of alginate, to tune the mechanical properties of the encapsulating matrix. Brain organoids grown in IPNs were viable, with the characteristic formation of neuroepithelial buds. However, organoid growth was significantly restricted in the stiffest matrix tested. Moreover, stiffer matrixes skewed cell populations toward mature neuronal phenotypes, with fewer and smaller neural rosettes. These findings demonstrate that the mechanics of the culture environment are important parameters in brain organoid development and show that the self-organizing capacity and subsequent architecture of brain organoids can be modulated by forces arising from growth-induced compression of the surrounding matrix. This study therefore suggests that carefully designing the mechanical properties of organoid encapsulation materials is a potential strategy to direct organoid growth and maturation toward desired structures.",NA,NA,NA

35048876,3,Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and polygenic score (PGS) analyses of AAO (n = 12 977) and PAO (n = 6773) were conducted in patients with bipolar disorder from 34 cohorts and a replication sample (n = 2237). The association of onset with disease characteristics was investigated in two of these cohorts.,METHOD,NA,NA
35048876,4,"Earlier AAO was associated with a higher probability of psychotic symptoms, suicidality, lower educational attainment, not living together and fewer episodes.

35069119,1,"The construction of the brain relies on a series of well-defined genetically and experience- or activity -dependent mechanisms which allow to adapt to the external environment. Disruption of these processes leads to neurological and psychiatric disorders, which in many cases are manifest already early in postnatal life. GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain is one of the major players in the early assembly and formation of neuronal circuits. In the prenatal and immediate postnatal period GABA, acting on GABAA receptors, depolarizes and excites targeted cells via an outwardly directed flux of chloride. In this way it activates NMDA receptors and voltage-dependent calcium channels contributing, through intracellular calcium rise, to shape neuronal activity and to establish, through the formation of new synapses and elimination of others, adult neuronal circuits. The direction of GABAA-mediated neurotransmission (depolarizing or hyperpolarizing) depends on the intracellular levels of chloride [Cl-]i, which in turn are maintained by the activity of the cation-chloride importer and exporter KCC2 and NKCC1, respectively. Thus, the premature hyperpolarizing action of GABA or its persistent depolarizing effect beyond the postnatal period, leads to behavioral deficits associated with morphological alterations and an excitatory (E)/inhibitory (I) imbalance in selective brain areas. The aim of this review is to summarize recent data concerning the functional role of GABAergic transmission in building up and refining neuronal circuits early in development and its dysfunction in neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs), schizophrenia and epilepsy. In particular, we focus on novel information concerning the mechanisms by which alterations in cation-chloride co-transporters (CCC) generate behavioral and cognitive impairment in these diseases. We discuss also the possibility to re-establish a proper GABAA-mediated neurotransmission and excitatory (E)/inhibitory (I) balance within selective brain areas acting on CCC.",NA,NA,NA
35083279,1,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of both upper and lower motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. ALS is associated with protein misfolding and inclusion formation involving RNA-binding proteins, including TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) and fused in sarcoma (FUS). The 125-kDa Matrin3 is a highly conserved nuclear DNA/RNA-binding protein that is implicated in many cellular processes, including binding and stabilizing mRNA, regulating mRNA nuclear export, modulating alternative splicing, and managing chromosomal distribution. Mutations in MATR3, the gene encoding Matrin3, have been identified as causal in familial ALS (fALS). Matrin3 lacks a prion-like domain that characterizes many other ALS-associated RNA-binding proteins, including TDP-43 and FUS, however, our bioinformatics analyses and preliminary studies document that Matrin3 contains long intrinsically disordered regions that may facilitate promiscuous interactions with many proteins and may contribute to its misfolding. In addition, these disordered regions in Matrin3 undergo numerous post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination and acetylation that modulate the function and misfolding of the protein. Here we discuss the disordered nature of Matrin3 and review the factors that may promote its misfolding and aggregation, two elements that might explain its role in ALS pathogenesis.",NA,NA,NA
35095525,1,"Aims: Observational studies of various dose levels of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) found that a high proportion of patients received a dose lower than the target dose tested in randomized controlled trials. There is a need to compare low-dose DOACs with warfarin or other DOACs on effectiveness and safety. Methods: Using administrative data from Quebec province, Canada, we built a cohort of new warfarin or DOAC users discharged from hospital between 2011 and 2017. We determined CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores, and comorbidities for 3-year prior cohort entry. The primary effectiveness endpoint was a composite of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism (SE), and secondary outcomes included a safety composite of major bleeding (MB) events and effectiveness composite (stroke/SE, death) at 1-year follow-up. We contrasted each low-dose DOAC with warfarin or other DOACs as references using inverse probability of treatment weighting to estimate marginal Cox hazard ratios (HRs). Results: The cohort comprised 22,969 patients (mean age: 80-86). We did not find a significant risk reduction for the stroke/SE primary effectiveness endpoint for DOACs vs. warfarin; however, we observed a significantly lower risk for low-dose dabigatran vs. warfarin (HR [95%CI]: 0.59 [0.42-0.81]) for effectiveness composite, mainly due to a lower death rate. The differences in effectiveness and safety composites between low-dose rivaroxaban vs. warfarin were not significant. However, low-dose apixaban had a better safety composite (HR: 0.68 [0.53-0.88]) vs. warfarin. Comparisons of dabigatran vs. apixaban showed a lower risk of stroke/SE (HR: 0.53 [0.30-0.93]) and a 2-fold higher risk of MB. The MB risk was higher for rivaroxaban than for apixaban (HR: 1.58 [1.09-2.29]). Conclusions: The results of this population-based study suggest that low-dose dabigatran has a better effective composite than warfarin. Compared with apixaban, low-dose dabigatran had a better effectiveness composite but a worse safety profile. Low-dose apixaban had a better safety composite than warfarin and other low-dose DOACs. Given that the comparative effectiveness and safety seem to vary from one DOAC to another, pharmacokinetic data for specific populations are now warranted.",NA,NA,NA

35158473,1,"Early intervention with well-tolerated disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is recommended in order to delay disease progression, reduce neurologic damage, preserve brain volume, and optimize long-term patient outcomes. Lack of conversion of new/newly enlarging T2 (NET2) or gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions to chronic hypointensities (black hole conversion) and achievement of no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) early in the course of treatment are considered potential indicators of treatment effect and predictors of longer-term clinical outcomes.",BACKGROUND,NA,NA

For analyses of the impact of early treatment and disease activity control, the newly diagnosed and non-newly diagnosed subgroups were further divided based on whether they initiated peginterferon beta-1a every 2 weeks (Q2W) starting in study year 1 (continuously treated) or peginterferon beta-1a Q2W or every 4 weeks in study year 2 (delayed treatment). Patient subgroups were evaluated for conversion of NET2 or Gd+ lesions to persistent black holes (PBHs), brain atrophy (percentage change in whole brain volume [WBV]), achievement of NEDA composite outcomes, and the association of these disease activity measures with longer-term clinical outcomes (annualized relapse rate [ARR] and confirmed disability worsening [CDW]).",METHODS,ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT01332019
35158473,3,"At 2 years, significantly fewer PBHs developed from NET2 lesions or Gd+ lesions in newly diagnosed and non-newly diagnosed patients continuously treated with peginterferon beta-1a than in the corresponding delayed-treatment groups (all p<0.0001).

NEDA rates remained stable over study years 2-4 for the newly diagnosed (range: 50.0%-53.9%) and non-newly diagnosed (range: 54.4%-57.0%) subgroups. Patients without PBH conversion had significantly lower ARR at 2 years (newly diagnosed: p = 0.0109; non-newly diagnosed: p = 0.0044) and a lower proportion of patients with 12-week CDW at 2 years (newly diagnosed: p = 0.2787; non-newly diagnosed: p = 0.0045) than the corresponding patient subgroups with PBH conversion. Patients who achieved NEDA in ADVANCE (study years 1-2) had a significantly lower ARR in ATTAIN (study years 3-4) than patients who did not achieve NEDA (newly diagnosed, p = 0.0003; non-newly diagnosed, p = 0.0001). Over 4 years, safety outcomes did not differ for the newly diagnosed and non-newly diagnosed patient subgroups.",RESULTS,NA,NA
